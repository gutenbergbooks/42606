<h5 class="lg125">PREFACE</h5>

  <p>This little book has been written in the hope that it may appeal to
  several classes of readers.</p>

  <p>Not infrequently I have been asked by friends of different callings in
  life to recommend them some book on mimicry which shall be reasonably
  short, well illustrated without being very costly, and not too hard to
  understand. I have always been obliged to tell them that I know of
  nothing in our language answering to this description, and it is largely
  as an attempt to remedy this deficiency that the present little volume
  has been written.</p>

  <p>I hope also that it will be found of interest to those who live in or
  visit tropical lands, and are attracted by the beauty of the butterfly
  life around them. There are few such countries without some of these
  cases of close resemblance between butterflies belonging to different
  families and groups, and it is to those who have the opportunity to be
  among them that we must look for fuller light upon one of the most
  fascinating of all nature's problems. If this little book serves to
  smooth the path of some who would become acquainted with that problem,
  and desire to use their opportunities of observation, the work that has
  gone to its making will have been well repaid.</p>

  <p>To those who cultivate biological thought from the more philosophical
  point of view, I venture to hope that what I have written may not be
  without appeal. At such a time as the present, big with impending changes
  in the social fabric, few things are more vital than a clear conception
  of the scope and workings of natural selection. Little enough is our
  certain knowledge of these things, and small though the butterfly's
  contribution may be I trust that it will not pass altogether
  unregarded.</p>

  <p>In conclusion I wish to offer my sincere thanks to those who have
  helped me in different ways. More especially are they due to my friends
  Dr Karl Jordan for the loan of some valuable specimens, and to Mr T. H.
  Riches for his kindly criticism on reading over the proof-sheets.</p>

<h5>CHAPTER I</h5>

<h5 class="scac">INTRODUCTORY</h5>

  <p>It is now more than fifty years since Darwin gave the theory of
  natural selection to the world, and the conception of a gradual evolution
  has long ago become part of the currency of thought. Evolution for Darwin
  was brought about by more than one factor. He believed in the inherited
  effects of the use and disuse of parts, and he also regarded sexual
  selection as operating at any rate among the higher animals. Yet he
  looked upon the natural selection of small favourable variations as the
  principal factor in evolutionary change. Since Darwin's time the trend
  has been to magnify natural selection at the expense of the other two
  factors. The doctrine of the inherited effects of use and disuse,
  vigorously challenged by Weismann, failed to make good its case, and it
  is to-day discredited by the great majority of biologists. Nor perhaps
  does the hypothesis of sexual selection command the support it originally
  had. At best it only attempted to explain those features, more especially
  among the higher animals, in which the sexes differ from one another in
  pattern, ornament, and the like. With the lapse of time there has come
  about a tendency to <!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page2"></a>{2}</span>find in natural selection alone a complete
  explanation of the process of evolution, and to regard it as the sole
  factor by which all evolutionary change is brought about. Evolution on
  this view is a gradual process depending upon the slow accumulation by
  natural selection of small variations, which are more or less inherited,
  till at last a well-marked change of type is brought about. Could we have
  before us all the stages through which a given form has passed as natural
  selection transforms it into another, they would constitute a continuous
  series such that even refined scrutiny might fail to distinguish between
  any two consecutive terms. If the slight variations are not of service
  they will get no favour from natural selection and so can lead to
  nothing. But if of use in the struggle for existence natural selection
  preserves them and subsequent variations in the same direction until at
  length man recognises the accumulation as a new form. Moreover when the
  perfect thing is once elaborated natural selection will keep it perfect
  by discouraging any tendency to vary from perfection.</p>

  <p>Upon this view, of which the most distinguished protagonist was
  Weismann, natural selection is the sole arbiter of animal and plant form.
  Through it and it alone the world has come to be what it is. To it must
  be ascribed all righteousness, for it alone is the maker. Such in its
  extreme form is the modern development of Darwin's great contribution to
  philosophy.</p>

  <p>But is it true? Will natural selection really serve to explain all?
  Must all the various characters of <!-- Page 3 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page3"></a>{3}</span>plants and animals be
  supposed to owe their existence to the gradual operation of this factor
  working upon small variations?</p>

  <p>Of recent years there has arisen a school of biologists to whom the
  terms mutationist and Mendelian are frequently applied. Influenced by the
  writings of Bateson and de Vries, and by the experimental results that
  have flowed from Mendel's discovery in heredity, they have come to regard
  the process of evolution as a discontinuous one. The new character that
  differentiates one variety from another arises suddenly as a sport or
  mutation, not by the gradual accretion of a vast number of intermediate
  forms. The white flowered plant has arisen suddenly from the blue, or the
  dwarf plant from the tall, and intermediates between them need never have
  existed. The ultimate fate of the new form that has arisen through causes
  yet unknown may depend upon natural selection. If better endowed than the
  parent form in the struggle for existence it may through natural
  selection come to supplant it. If worse endowed natural selection will
  probably see to its elimination. But if, as may quite possibly happen, it
  is neither better nor worse adapted than the form from which it sprang,
  then there would seem to be no reason for natural selection having
  anything to do with the relation of the new form to its parent.</p>

  <p>Between the older and the newer or mutationist point of view an
  outstanding difference is the rôle ascribed to natural selection. On the
  one view it <!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page4"></a>{4}</span>builds up the new variety bit by bit, on the
  other the appearance of the new variety is entirely independent of it.
  From this there follows a radical difference with regard to the meaning
  of all the varied characters of plants and animals. Those who uphold the
  all-powerfulness of natural selection are bound to regard every character
  exhibited by an animal or plant as of service to it in the struggle for
  existence. Else it could not have arisen through the operation of natural
  selection. In other words every character in plant or animal must be
  adaptive. On the mutationist view this of course does not follow. If the
  new character which arises independently of natural selection is neither
  of service nor disservice to its possessors in the struggle for
  existence, there seems no reason why it should not persist in spite of
  natural selection. In attempting to decide between the two conflicting
  views the study of adaptation is of the first importance.</p>

  <p>It was perhaps in connection with adaptation that Darwin obtained the
  most striking evidence in support of his theory, and it is clear from his
  writings that it was in this field he laboured with most delight. The
  marvellous ways in which creatures may be adapted in structure and habit
  for the life they lead had not escaped the attention of the older
  naturalists. John Ray wrote a book<a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> upon the subject in which he pointed
  out that all things in the Universe, from the fixed stars to the
  structure of a bird, or the tongue of <!-- Page 5 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page5"></a>{5}</span>a chameleon, or the means
  whereby some seeds are wind distributed, are "argumentative of Providence
  and Design" and must owe their existence to "the Direction of a Superior
  Cause." Nor have there been wanting other authors who have been equally
  struck by the wonders of adaptation. But their studies generally led to
  the same conclusion, an exhortation to praise the infinite Wisdom of Him
  Who in the days of Creation had taken thought for all these things.</p>

  <p>The advent of natural selection threw a new light upon adaptation and
  the appearance of design in the world. In such books as those on <i>The
  Fertilization of Orchids</i> and <i>The Forms of Flowers</i> Darwin
  sought to shew that many curious and elaborate structures which had long
  puzzled the botanist were of service to the plant, and might therefore
  have arisen through the agency of natural selection. Especially was this
  the case in orchids where Darwin was able to bring forward striking
  evidence in favour of regarding many a bizarre form of flower as
  specially adapted for securing the benefits of cross-fertilization
  through the visits of insects. In these and other books Darwin opened up
  a new and fascinating field of investigation, and thenceforward the
  subject of adaptation claimed the attention of many naturalists. For the
  most part it has been an observational rather than an experimental study.
  The naturalist is struck by certain peculiarities in the form or colour
  or habits of a species. His problem is to account for their presence, and
  as nearly all students of adaptation have been close <!-- Page 6 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>{6}</span>followers of Darwin, this
  generally means an interpretation in terms of natural selection. Granted
  this factor it remains to shew that the character in question confers
  some advantage upon the individuals that possess it. For unless it has a
  utilitarian value of some sort it clearly cannot have arisen through the
  operation of natural selection. However when it comes to the point direct
  proof of this sort is generally difficult to obtain. Consequently the
  work of most students of adaptation consists in a description of the
  character or characters studied together with such details of its
  life-history as may seem to bear upon the point, and a suggestion as to
  how the particular character studied <i>may</i> be of value to its
  possessors in the struggle for existence. In this way a great body of
  most curious and interesting facts has been placed on record, and many
  ingenious suggestions have been made as to the possible use of this or
  that character. But the majority of workers have taken natural selection
  for granted and then interested themselves in shewing how the characters
  studied by them might be of use. Probably there is no structure or habit
  for which it is impossible to devise some use<a name="footnotetag2"
  href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, and the pursuit has doubtless
  provided many of its devotees with a pleasurable and often fascinating
  exercise of the imagination. So it has come about that the facts <!--
  Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>{7}</span>instead of
  being used as a test of the credibility of natural selection, serve
  merely to emphasise the pæan of praise with which such exercises usually
  conclude. The whole matter is too often approached in much the same
  spirit as that in which John Ray approached it two centuries ago, except
  that the Omnipotency of the Deity is replaced by the Omnipotency of
  Natural Selection. The vital point, which is whether Natural Selection
  <i>does</i> offer a satisfactory explanation of the living world, is too
  frequently lost sight of. Whether we are bound or not to interpret all
  the phenomena of life in terms of natural selection touches the basis of
  modern philosophy. It is for the biologist to attempt to find an answer,
  and there are few more profitable lines of attack than a critical
  examination of the facts of adaptation. Though "mimicry" is but a small
  corner in this vast field of inquiry it is a peculiarly favourable one
  owing to the great interest which it has excited for many years and the
  consequently considerable store of facts that has been accumulated. If
  then we would attempt to settle this most weighty point in philosophy
  there is probably nothing to which we can appeal with more confidence
  than to the butterfly.</p>

<h5>CHAPTER II</h5>

<h5 class="scac">MIMICRY&mdash;BATESIAN AND MÜLLERIAN</h5>

  <p>Mimicry is a special branch of the study of adaptation. The term has
  sometimes been used loosely to include cases where an animal, most
  frequently an insect, bears a strong and often most remarkable
  resemblance to some feature of its inanimate surroundings. Many
  butterflies with wings closed are wonderfully like dead leaves; certain
  spiders when at rest on a leaf look exactly like bird-droppings; "looper"
  caterpillars simulate small twigs; the names of the "stick-" and "leaf-"
  insects are in themselves an indication of their appearance. Such cases
  as these, in which the creature exhibits a resemblance to some part of
  its natural surroundings, should be classified as cases of "protective
  resemblance" in contradistinction to mimicry proper. Striking examples of
  protective resemblance are abundant, and though we possess little
  critical knowledge of the acuity of perception in birds and other insect
  feeders it is plausible to regard the resemblances as being of definite
  advantage in the struggle for existence. However, it is with mimicry and
  not with protective coloration in general that we are here directly <!--
  Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>{9}</span>concerned,
  and the nature of the phenomenon may perhaps best be made clear by a
  brief account of the facts which led to the statement of the theory.</p>

  <p>In the middle of last century the distinguished naturalist, H. W.
  Bates, was engaged in making collections in parts of the Amazon region.
  He paid much attention to butterflies, in which group he discovered a
  remarkably interesting phenomenon<a name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>. Among the species which he took
  were a large number belonging to the group Ithomiinae, small butterflies
  of peculiar appearance with long slender bodies and narrow wings bearing
  in most cases a conspicuous pattern (cf. <a href="#plateX">Pl. X</a>,
  fig. 7). When Bates came to examine his catch more closely he discovered
  that among the many Ithomiines were a few specimens very like them in
  general shape, colour, and markings, but differing in certain anatomical
  features by which the Pierinae, or "whites," are separated from other
  groups. Most Pierines are very different from Ithomiines. It is the group
  to which our common cabbage butterfly belongs and the ground colour is
  generally white. The shape of the body and also of the wings is in
  general quite distinct from what it is in the Ithomiines. Nevertheless in
  these particular districts certain of the species of Pierines had
  departed widely from what is usually regarded as their ancestral pattern
  (<a href="#plateX">Pl. X</a>, fig. 1) and had come to resemble very
  closely the far more abundant Ithomiines among whom they habitually flew
  (cf. <a href="#plateX">Pl. X</a>, figs. 2 and 3). To <!-- Page 10
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"></a>{10}</span>use Bates' term
  they "mimicked" the Ithomiines, and he set to work to devise an
  explanation of how this could have come about. The <i>Origin of
  Species</i> had just appeared and it was natural that Bates should seek
  to interpret this peculiar phenomenon on the lines there laid down. How
  was it that these Pierines had come to depart so widely from the general
  form of the great bulk of their relations, and to mimic so closely in
  appearance species belonging to an entirely different group, while at the
  same time conserving the more deeply seated anatomical features of their
  own family? If the change was to be regarded as having come about through
  the agency of natural selection it must clearly be of advantage to the
  mimicking forms; otherwise natural selection could not come into
  operation. What advantage then have the Ithomiines over the majority of
  butterflies in those parts? They are small insects, rather flimsy in
  build, with comparatively weak powers of flight, and yet so conspicuously
  coloured that they can hardly be mistaken for anything else. In spite of
  all this they are little subject to the attacks of enemies such as birds,
  and Bates attributed this to the fact that the juices of their bodies are
  unpalatable. According to him their striking and conspicuous pattern is
  of the nature of a warning coloration, advertising their disagreeable
  properties to possible enemies. A bird which had once attempted to eat
  one would find it little to its taste. It would thenceforward associate
  the conspicuous pattern with a disagreeable flavour <!-- Page 11 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>{11}</span>and in future leave such
  butterflies severely alone. The more conspicuous the pattern the more
  readily would it be noticed by the enemy, and so it would be of advantage
  to the Ithomiine to possess as striking a pattern as possible. Those
  butterflies shewing a tendency to a more conspicuous pattern would be
  more immune to the attacks of birds and so would have a better chance of
  leaving progeny than those with a less conspicuous pattern. In this way
  variations in the direction of greater conspicuousness would be
  accumulated gradually by natural selection, and so would be built up in
  the Ithomiine the striking warning coloration by which it advertises its
  disagreeable properties. Such is the first step in the making of a
  mimicry case&mdash;the building up through natural selection of a
  conspicuous pattern in an unpalatable species by means of which it is
  enabled to advertise its disagreeable properties effectively and thereby
  secure immunity from the attacks of enemies which are able to appreciate
  the advertisement. Such patterns and colours are said to be of a
  "warning" nature. The existence of an unpalatable model in considerable
  numbers is the first step in the production of a mimetic resemblance
  through the agency of natural selection.</p>

  <p>We come back now to our Pierine which must be assumed to shew the
  general characters and coloration of the family of whites to which they
  belong (cf. <a href="#plateX">Pl. X</a>, fig. 1). Theoretically they are
  not specially protected by nauseous properties from enemies and hence
  their conspicuous white coloration renders <!-- Page 12 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>{12}</span>them especially liable to
  attack. If, however, they could exchange their normal dress for one
  resembling that of the Ithomiines it is clear that they would have a
  chance of being mistaken for the latter and consequently of being left
  alone. Moreover, in certain cases these Pierines <i>have</i> managed to
  discard their normal dress and assume that of the Ithomiines. On
  theoretical grounds this must clearly be of advantage to them, and being
  so might conceivably have arisen through the operation of natural
  selection. This indeed is what is supposed to have taken place on the
  theory of mimicry. Those Pierines which exhibited a variation of colour
  in the direction of the Ithomiine "model" excited distrust in the minds
  of would-be devourers, who had learned from experience to associate that
  particular type of coloration with a disagreeable taste. Such Pierines
  would therefore have a rather better chance of surviving and of leaving
  offspring. Some of the offspring would exhibit the variation in a more
  marked degree and these again would in consequence have a yet better
  chance of surviving. Natural selection would encourage those varying in
  the direction of the Ithomiine model at the expense of the rest and by
  its continuous operation there would gradually be built up those
  beautiful cases of resemblance which have excited the admiration of
  naturalists.</p>

  <p>Wallace was the next after Bates to interest himself in mimicry and,
  from his study of the butterflies of the Oriental region<a
  name="footnotetag4" href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>, shewed that in
  this part of <!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page13"></a>{13}</span>the world too there existed these remarkable
  resemblances between species belonging to different families. Perhaps the
  most important part of Wallace's contribution was the demonstration that
  in some species not only was it the female alone that "mimicked" but that
  there might be several different forms of female mimicking different
  models, and in some cases all unlike the male of their own species. One
  of the species studied by Wallace, <i>Papilio polytes</i>, is shewn on <a
  href="#plateV">Plate V</a>. We shall have occasion to refer to this case
  later on, and it is sufficient here to call attention to the three
  different forms of female, of which one is like the male while the other
  two resemble two other species of <i>Papilio</i>, <i>P. hector</i> and
  <i>P. aristolochiae</i>, which occur in the same localities. Instances
  where the female alone of some unprotected species mimics a model with
  obnoxious properties are common in all tropical countries. It has been
  suggested that this state of things has come about owing to the greater
  need of protection on the part of the female. Hampered by the disposal of
  the next generation the less protected female would be at a greater
  disadvantage as compared with the mimic than would the corresponding male
  whose obligations to posterity are more rapidly discharged. The view of
  course makes the assumption that the female transmits her peculiar
  properties to her daughters but not to her sons.</p>

  <p>A few years later Trimen<a name="footnotetag5"
  href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> did for Africa what Bates had done
  for America and Wallace for <!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page14"></a>{14}</span>Indo-Malaya. It was in this paper that he
  elucidated that most remarkable of all cases of mimicry&mdash;<i>Papilio
  dardanus</i> with his harem of different consorts, all tailless, all
  unlike himself, and often wonderfully similar to unpalatable forms found
  in the same localities (cf. p. <a href="#page30">30</a>).</p>

  <p>We may now turn to one of the most ingenious developments of the
  theory of mimicry. Not long after Bates' original memoir appeared
  attention was directed to a group of cases which could not be explained
  on the simple hypothesis there put forward. Many striking cases of
  resemblance had been adduced in which both species obviously belonged to
  the presumably unpalatable groups. Instances of the sort had been
  recorded by Bates himself and are perhaps most plentiful in South America
  between species belonging respectively to the Ithomiinae and Heliconinae.
  On the theory of mimicry all the members of both of these groups must be
  regarded as specially protected owing to their conspicuous coloration and
  distasteful properties. What advantage then can an Ithomiine be supposed
  to gain by mimicking a Heliconine, or <i>vice versâ</i>? Why should a
  species exchange its own bright and conspicuous warning pattern for one
  which is neither brighter nor more conspicuous? To Fritz Müller, the
  well-known correspondent of Darwin, belongs the credit of having
  suggested a way out of the difficulty. Müller's explanation turns upon
  the education of birds. Every year there hatch into the world fresh
  generations of young birds, and each <!-- Page 15 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page15"></a>{15}</span>generation has to learn
  afresh from experience what is pleasant to eat and what is not. They will
  try all things and hold fast to that which is good. They will learn to
  associate the gay colours of the Heliconine and the Ithomiine with an
  evil taste<a name="footnotetag6" href="#footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> and
  they will thenceforward avoid butterflies which advertise themselves by
  means of these particular colour combinations. But in a locality where
  there are many models, each with a different pattern and colour complex,
  each will have to be tested separately before the unpalatableness of each
  is realised. If for example a thousand young birds started their
  education on a population of butterflies in which there were five
  disagreeable species, each with a distinct warning pattern, it is clear
  that one thousand of each would devote their lives to the education of
  these birds, or five thousand butterflies in all<a name="footnotetag7"
  href="#footnote7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>. But if these five species, instead
  of shewing five distinct warning patterns, all displayed the same one it
  is evident that the education of the birds would be accomplished at the
  price of but one thousand butterfly existences instead of five. Even if
  one of the five species were far more abundant than the others it would
  yet be to its advantage that the other four should exhibit the same
  warning pattern. Even though the losses were distributed <i>pro rata</i>
  the more abundant species would profit to some extent. For <!-- Page 16
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"></a>{16}</span>the less
  abundant species the gain would of course be relatively greater.
  Theoretically therefore, all of the five species would profit if in place
  of five distinct warning patterns they exhibited but a single one in
  common. And since it is profitable to all concerned what more natural
  than that it should be brought about by natural selection?</p>

  <p>Müller's views are now widely accepted by students of mimicry as an
  explanation of these curious cases where two or more evidently
  distasteful species closely resemble one another. Indeed the tendency in
  recent years has been to see Müllerian mimicry everywhere, and many of
  the instances which were long regarded as simple Batesian cases have now
  been relegated to this category. The hypothesis is, of course, based upon
  what appears to man to be the natural behaviour of young birds under
  certain conditions. No one knows whether young birds actually do behave
  in the way that they are supposed to. In the absence of any such body of
  facts the Müllerian hypothesis cannot rank as more than a plausible
  suggestion, and, as will appear later, it is open to severe criticism on
  general grounds.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the next contribution to the subject of mimicry which must
  rank of the first importance was that of Erich Haase<a
  name="footnotetag8" href="#footnote8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>, to whose book
  students of these matters must always be under a heavy obligation. It was
  the first and still remains the chief work of general scope. Since
  Haase's day great numbers of <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page17"></a>{17}</span>fresh instances of mimetic resemblance have
  been recorded from all the great tropical areas of the world, and the
  list is being added to continually. Most active in this direction is the
  Oxford School under Professor Poulton to whose untiring efforts are
  largely due the substantial increases in our knowledge of African
  butterflies contributed by various workers in the field during the past
  few years. Whatever the interpretation put upon them, there can be no
  question as to the value of the facts brought together, more especially
  those referring to the nature of the families raised in captivity from
  various mimetic forms. With the considerable additions from Africa<a
  name="footnotetag9" href="#footnote9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> during the past
  few years several hundreds of cases of mimicry must now have been
  recorded. Some of the best known and most striking from among these will
  be described briefly in the next two chapters.</p>

<h5>CHAPTER III</h5>

<h5 class="scac">OLD-WORLD MIMICS</h5>

  <p>The earlier naturalists who studied butterflies made use of colour and
  pattern very largely in arranging and classifying their specimens.
  Insects shewing the same features in these respects were generally placed
  together without further question, especially if they were known to come
  from the same locality. In looking through old collections of butterflies
  from the tropics it is not infrequent to find that the collector was
  deceived by a mimetic likeness into placing model and mimic together.
  During the last century, however, more attention was paid to the anatomy
  of butterflies, with the result that their classification was placed upon
  a basis of structure. As in all work of the sort certain features are
  selected, partly owing to their constancy and partly for their
  convenience, the insects being arranged according as to whether they
  present these features or not. Everybody knows that the butterflies as a
  group are separated from the moths on the ground that their antennae are
  club shaped at the end, while those of the moth are generally filamentary
  and taper to a fine point. <!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>The butterflies themselves may be subdivided into five main groups or
  families<a name="footnotetag10" href="#footnote10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>
  according to the structure of the first of their three pairs of legs. In
  the Papilionidae or "swallow-tails," the first pair of legs is well
  developed in both sexes (Fig. 8). In the Pieridae or "whites," the front
  legs are also similar in both sexes, but the claws are bifid and a median
  process, the empodium, is found between them (Fig. 7). In the remaining
  three families the front legs differ in the two sexes. The females of the
  Lycaenidae or "blues" have well-developed front legs in which the tarsus
  is terminated by definite claws (Fig. 5), whereas in the males the
  terminal part of the leg, or tarsus, is unjointed and furnished with but
  a single small claw (Fig. 6). This reduction of the front legs has gone
  somewhat further in the Erycinidae (Figs. 3 and 4), a family consisting
  for the most part of rather small butterflies and specially
  characteristic of South America. In the great family of the Nymphalidae
  the reduction of the front legs is well marked in both sexes. Not only
  are they much smaller than in the other groups, but claws are lacking in
  the female as well as in the male (Figs. 1 and 2).</p>

  <p>Though the structure of the fore limbs is the character specially
  chosen for separating these different families from one another, it is of
  course understood that they differ from one another in various other
  distinctive features. The chrysalis of the Nymphalidae for example hangs
  head downwards suspended by the <!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page21"></a>{21}</span>tail, whereas in the Pieridae and
  Papilionidae metamorphosis takes place with the chrysalis attached by the
  tail but supported also by a fine girdle of silk round the middle so that
  the head is uppermost. The larvae also afford characters by which some of
  the families may be distinguished&mdash;those of the Papilionidae for
  example having a process on the back which can be extruded or
  retracted.</p>

  <p>Owing to the great size of the family of the Nymphalidae, in which the
  number of species approaches 5000, it is convenient to deal with the
  eight sub-groups into which it has been divided. The characters serving
  to mark off the sub-groups from one another are various. Sometimes it is
  the minuter structure of the tarsus, at others the form of the
  caterpillar or the chrysalis, at others the arrangement of the nervures
  that form the skeleton of the wing. Into these systematic details,
  however, we need not enter more fully here<a name="footnotetag11"
  href="#footnote11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>. What is important from the
  standpoint of mimicry is that these divisions, made solely on anatomical
  structure, correspond closely with the separation of models from mimics.
  Of the eight sub-families into which the Nymphalidae are divided four,
  viz. the Danainae, Acraeinae, Heliconinae, and Ithomiinae, provide models
  and some, but far fewer, mimics; two, the Satyrinae and Nymphalinae,
  provide many mimics and but few models, while two groups, the Morphinae
  and Brassolinae, practically do not enter into the mimicry story. <!--
  Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"></a>{22}</span></p>

  <p>Simple mimicry, explicable, at any rate in theory, on the lines laid
  down by Bates, is a phenomenon of not infrequent occurrence in tropical
  countries, though rare in more temperate lands. In each of the three
  great divisions of the tropical world we find certain groups of
  butterflies serving as models, and being mimicked by butterflies
  belonging as a rule to quite different groups. Speaking generally the
  models of any given region are confined to a few groups, while the mimics
  are drawn from a greater number. In Asia the principal models belong to
  the Danaines, the Euploeines, and to a group of swallow-tails which from
  the fact that their larvae feed on the poisonous <i>Aristolochia</i>
  plant are generally distinguished as the "Poison-eaters," or
  <i>Pharmacophagus</i> group. Of these the Danaines and Euploeines are
  closely related and have much in common. They are usually butterflies of
  medium size, of rather flimsy build and with a somewhat slow and
  flaunting flight. In spite, however, of their slight build they are
  toughly made and very tenacious of life. Most butterflies are easily
  killed by simply nipping the thorax. There is a slight crack and the fly
  never recovers. But the collector who treats a Danaid in a way that would
  easily kill most butterflies is as likely as not many hours after to find
  it still alive in his collecting box or in the paper to which it may have
  been transferred when caught. They give one the impression of being
  tougher and more "rubbery" in consistence than the majority of
  Lepidoptera. Moreover, the juices of their bodies seem <!-- Page 23
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>{23}</span>to be more oily
  and less easily dried up. In general colour scheme they vary a great
  deal. Some, such as <i>Danais chrysippus</i> (<a href="#plateIV">Pl.
  IV</a>, fig. 1), are conspicuous with their bright fulvous-brown ground
  colour and the sharp white markings on the black tips of their fore
  wings. Others again such as <i>Danais septentrionis</i> (<a
  href="#plateI">Pl. I</a>, fig. 3), with a dark network of lines on a pale
  greenish ground, are not nearly so conspicuous. Of the Euploeines some
  have a beautiful deep blue metallic lustre (cf. <a href="#plateII">Pl.
  II</a>, fig. 4), though many are of a plain sombre brown relieved only by
  an inconspicuous border of lighter markings (cf. <a href="#plateI">Pl.
  I</a>, fig. 10).</p>

  <p>Both Danaines and Euploeines serve as models for a great variety of
  species belonging to different groups. <i>Danais septentrionis</i> (<a
  href="#plateI">Pl. I</a>, fig. 3) is a very abundant species in India and
  Ceylon, and in the same region there are several other very similar
  species. Flying with them in Northern India are two species of
  <i>Papilio</i>, <i>P. macareus</i> and <i>P. xenocles</i> (<a
  href="#plateI">Pl. I</a>, fig. 4), which resemble these Danaids fairly
  closely. In Southern India and Ceylon one of the two forms of <i>Papilio
  clytia</i> (<a href="#plateI">Pl. I</a>, fig. 7) is also regarded as a
  mimic of these Danaids. In the same part of the world there is a Pierine
  of the genus <i>Pareronia</i>, whose female is very like these Danaines
  on the upper surface (<a href="#plateI">Pl. I</a>, fig. 1). The male of
  this Pierine is quite distinct from the female (<a href="#plateI">Pl.
  I</a>, fig. 2).</p>

  <p>The common <i>Danais chrysippus</i> (<a href="#plateIV">Pl. IV</a>,
  fig. 1), found in this region, has been described as probably the most
  abundant butterfly in the world, and serves <!-- Page 24 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page24"></a>{24}</span>as a model for several
  species belonging to different groups. It and its mimics will, however,
  be described in more detail later on. Mention must also be made of the
  striking case of the Danaid, <i>Caduga tytia</i> and its Papilionine
  mimic <i>P. agestor</i> from Sikkim (<a href="#plateII">Pl. II</a>, figs.
  2 and 3). In both species the fore wings are pale blue broken by black;
  while the hind wings are pale with a deep outer border of rusty red. Not
  only in colour but also in shape the swallow-tail bears a remarkable
  resemblance to the Danaid. <i>C. tytia</i> is also mimicked by a rare
  Nymphaline <i>Neptis imitans</i>, which exhibits the same striking colour
  scheme so very different from that of most of its allies.</p>

  <p>No less remarkable are some of the cases in which the Euploeines serve
  as models. <i>E. rhadamanthus</i>, for example, is mimicked by the scarce
  <i>Papilio mendax</i>, and a glance at Figs. 8 and 9 on <a
  href="#plateII">Plate II</a> shews how well this butterfly deserves its
  name. <i>Euploea rhadamanthus</i> also serves as a model for one of the
  several forms of female of the Nymphaline species <i>Euripus
  halitherses</i>. In some Euploeines the sexes are different in
  appearance&mdash;a somewhat unusual thing among butterflies serving as
  models in cases of mimetic resemblance. Such a difference is found in
  <i>Euploea mulciber</i>, the male being predominantly brown with a
  beautiful deep blue suffusion, while the female is a rather lighter
  insect with less of the blue suffusion and with hind wings streaked with
  lighter markings (<a href="#plateII">Pl. II</a>, figs. 4 and 5). It is
  interesting to find that <i>Elymnias malelas</i>, a Satyrid which mimics
  this species, <!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page25"></a>{25}</span>shews a similar difference in the two sexes
  (<a href="#plateII">Pl. II</a>, figs. 6 and 7).</p>

  <p>It is remarkable that similar sexual difference is also shewn by the
  rare <i>Papilio paradoxus</i>, the two sexes here again mimicking
  respectively the two sexes of <i>Euploea mulciber</i>.</p>

  <p>Many of the Euploeines, more especially those from Southern India and
  Ceylon, lack the blue suffusion, and are sombre brown insects somewhat
  relieved by lighter markings along the hinder border of the hind wings.
  <i>Euploea core</i> (<a href="#plateI">Pl. I</a>, fig. 10), a very common
  insect, is typical of this group. A similar coloration is found in one of
  the forms of <i>Papilio clytia</i> (<a href="#plateI">Pl. I</a>, fig. 8)
  from the same region as well as in the female of the Nymphaline species
  <i>Hypolimnas bolina</i> (<a href="#plateI">Pl. I</a>, fig. 6). The male
  of this last species (<a href="#plateI">Pl. I</a>, fig. 5) is quite
  unlike its female, but is not unlike the male of the allied species,
  <i>H. misippus</i>, which it resembles in the very dark wings each with a
  white patch in the centre, the junction of light and dark being in each
  case marked by a beautiful purple-blue suffusion. There is also a species
  of <i>Elymnias</i> (<i>E. singhala</i>) in this part of the world which
  in general colour scheme is not widely dissimilar from these brown
  Euploeas (<a href="#plateI">Pl. I</a>, fig. 9).</p>

  <p>The third main group of models characteristic of this region belongs
  to the Papilionidae. It was pointed out by Haase some 20 years ago that
  this great family falls into three definite sections, separable on
  anatomical grounds (see Appendix II). One of these sections he termed the
  <i>Pharmacophagus</i> or "poison-eating" <!-- Page 26 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page26"></a>{26}</span>group owing to the fact
  that the larvae feed on the poisonous climbing plants of the genus
  <i>Aristolochia</i>. It is from this group that all Papilios which serve
  as models are drawn. No mimics of other unpalatable groups such as
  Danaines are to be found among the Oriental Poison-eaters. In the other
  two sections of the genus mimics are not infrequent (cf. Appendix II),
  though probably none of them serve as models. To the Pharmacophagus group
  belong the most gorgeous insects of Indo-Malaya&mdash;the magnificent
  Ornithoptera, largest and most splendid of butterflies. It is not a large
  proportion of the members of the group which serve as models, and these
  on the whole are among the smaller and less conspicuous forms. In all
  cases the mimic, when a butterfly, belongs to the <i>Papilio</i> section
  of the three sections into which Haase divided the family (cf. Appendix
  II). <i>Papilio aristolochiae</i> (<a href="#plateV">Pl. V</a>, fig. 5),
  for example, is mimicked by a female form of <i>Papilio polytes</i>, and
  the geographical varieties of this widely spread model are generally
  closely paralleled by those of the equally wide spread mimic. For both
  forms range from Western India across to Eastern China. Another
  poison-eater, <i>P. coon</i>, provides a model for one of the females of
  the common <i>P. memnon</i>. It is curious that in those species of the
  poison-eaters which serve as models the sexes are practically identical
  in pattern, and are mimicked by certain females only of the other two
  Papilio groups, whereas in the Ornithoptera, which also belong to the
  poison-eaters, the difference between the sexes is exceedingly striking.
  <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page27"></a>{27}</span></p>

  <p>Though the Pharmacophagus Papilios are mimicked only by other Papilios
  among butterflies they may serve occasionally as models for certain of
  the larger day-flying moths. <i>Papilio polyxenus</i>, for example, is
  mimicked not only by the unprotected <i>P. bootes</i> but also by the
  moth <i>Epicopeia polydora</i> (<a href="#plateIII">Pl. III</a>, figs. 5
  and 6). Like the butterfly the <i>Epicopeia</i>, which is comparatively
  rare, has the white patch and the outer border of red marginal spots on
  the hind wing. Though it is apparently unable to provide itself with an
  orthodox tail it nevertheless makes a creditable attempt at one. There
  are several other cases of mimetic resemblance between day-flying moths
  and Pharmacophagus swallow-tails&mdash;the latter in each case serving as
  the model. Rarely it may happen that the rôle of butterfly and moth is
  reversed, and the butterfly becomes the mimic. A very remarkable instance
  of this is found in New Guinea where the rare <i>Papilio laglaizei</i>
  mimics the common day-flying moth <i>Alcidis agathyrsus</i>. Viewed from
  above the resemblance is sufficiently striking (<a href="#plateIII">Pl.
  III</a>, figs. 1 and 2), but the most wonderful feature concerns the
  underneath. The ventral half of the moth's abdomen is coloured brilliant
  orange. When the wings are folded back they cover and hide from sight
  only the dorsal part of the abdomen, so that in this position the orange
  neutral surface is conspicuous. When, however, the wings of the butterfly
  are folded they conceal the whole of the abdomen. But the butterfly has
  developed on each hind wing itself a bright orange patch in such a
  position that when the <!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page28"></a>{28}</span>wings are folded back the orange patch lies
  over the sides of the abdomen. In this way is simulated the brilliant
  abdomen of the moth by a butterfly, in which, as in its relations, this
  part is of a dark and sombre hue.</p>

  <p>A few models are also provided in the Oriental region by the genus
  <i>Delias</i>, which belongs to the Pierines. A common form, <i>Delias
  eucharis</i>, is white above but the under surface of the hind wings is
  conspicuous with yellow and scarlet (<a href="#plateII">Pl. II</a>, fig.
  1). It has been suggested that this species serves as a model for another
  and closely allied Pierine, <i>Prioneris sita</i>, a species distinctly
  scarcer than the <i>Delias</i>. There is some evidence that the latter is
  distasteful (cf. p. <a href="#page115">115</a>), but nothing is known of
  the <i>Prioneris</i> in this respect. Other species of <i>Delias</i> are
  said to function as models for certain day-flying moths belonging to the
  family Chalcosiidae, which may bear a close resemblance to them. In
  certain cases it may happen that the moth is more abundant than the
  Pierine that it resembles<a name="footnotetag12"
  href="#footnote12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Tropical Africa is probably more wealthy in mimetic analogies than
  Indo-Malaya, and the African cases have recently been gathered together
  by Eltringham in a large and beautifully illustrated memoir<a
  name="footnotetag13" href="#footnote13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>. The
  principal models of the region are furnished by the Danainae and the
  allied group of the Acraeinae. Of the Danaines one well-known model,
  <i>Danais chrysippus</i>, <!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page29"></a>{29}</span>is common to Africa and to Indo-Malaya.
  Common also to the two regions are the mimics, <i>Argynnis hyperbius</i>
  and <i>Hypolimnas misippus</i> (cf. <a href="#plateIV">Pl. IV</a>, figs.
  3 and 7). The case of the last named is peculiarly interesting because it
  presents well-marked varieties which can be paralleled by similar ones in
  <i>D. chrysippus</i>. In addition to the typical form with the dark
  tipped fore wing relieved by a white bar there is in each species a form
  uniformly brown, lacking both the dark tip and the white bar of the fore
  wing. There is also another form in the two species in which the hind
  wing is almost white instead of the usual brown shade. In both species,
  moreover, the white hind wing may be associated either with the uniformly
  brown fore wing or with the typical form. There is also another common
  African butterfly, <i>Acraea encedon</i>, in which these different
  patterns are closely paralleled (cf. <a href="#plateIX">Pl. IX</a>).
  Several other species of butterflies and a few diurnal moths bear a more
  or less close resemblance to <i>D. chrysippus</i>.</p>

  <p>Danaine butterflies with the dark interlacing fines on a pale
  greenish-blue ground, so characteristic of the Oriental region, are
  represented in Africa by the species <i>Danais petiverana</i> (<a
  href="#plateVI">Pl. VI</a>, fig. 1) ranging across the continent from
  Sierra Leone to British East Africa. A common Papilio, <i>P. leonidas</i>
  (<a href="#plateVI">Pl. VI</a>, fig. 2) has a similar extensive range,
  and has been regarded as a mimic of the Danaine. In S. Africa <i>P.
  leonidas</i> is represented by the variety <i>brasidas</i> in which the
  white spots are reduced and the blue-green ground is lacking.
  <i>Brasidas</i> bears a strong resemblance to the tropical <!-- Page 30
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>{30}</span>Danaine
  <i>Amauris hyalites</i> (<a href="#plateVI">Pl. VI</a>, fig. 3) of which
  it has been regarded as a mimic. It must however be added that it is only
  over a small part of their respective ranges, viz. in Angola, that the
  two species are to be met with together.</p>

  <p>The butterflies belonging to the genus <i>Amauris</i> are among the
  most abundant and characteristic Danaine models of Africa. Some of the
  black and white species such as <i>A. niavius</i> (<a
  href="#plateVIII">Pl. VIII</a>, fig. 6) are conspicuous insects in a
  cabinet. Others again, such as <i>A. echeria</i> (<a
  href="#plateVIII">Pl. VIII</a>, fig. 7), are relatively sombre-looking
  forms. Among the best known mimics of the genus is a species of
  <i>Hypolimnas</i><a name="footnotetag14"
  href="#footnote14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>&mdash;<i>H. dubius</i>. This
  interesting form is polymorphic and mimics different species of
  <i>Amauris</i>. The variety <i>wahlbergi</i>, for example, is very like
  <i>A. niavius</i>, while <i>mima</i> strongly resembles <i>A. echeria</i>
  (<a href="#plateVIII">Pl. VIII</a>, figs. 8 and 9). It was at one time
  supposed that these two varieties of <i>Hypolimnas dubius</i> were
  different species and the matter was only definitely settled when the two
  forms were bred from the eggs of the same female. Other mimics of
  <i>Amauris</i> are found among the Papilios and the Nymphaline genus
  <i>Pseudacraea</i>.</p>

  <p>But among all the mimics of Danaines in Africa and elsewhere
  <i>Papilio dardanus</i> is pre-eminent, and has been described by more
  than one writer as the most important case of mimicry in existence. Not
  only does it shew remarkable resemblances to various <!-- Page 31
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"></a>{31}</span>Danaids, but it
  presents features of such peculiar interest that it must be considered in
  more detail. <i>Papilio dardanus</i> in its various sub-races is spread
  over nearly all the African continent south of the Sahara. Over all this
  area the male, save for relatively small differences, remains
  unchanged&mdash;a lemon-yellow insect, tailed, and with black markings on
  fore and hind wings (<a href="#plateVIII">Pl. VIII</a>, fig. 1). The
  female, however, exhibits an extraordinary range of variation. In South
  Africa she appears in three guises, (1) the <i>cenea</i> form resembling
  <i>Amauris echeria</i>, (2) the <i>hippocoon</i> form like <i>Amauris
  niavius</i>, and (3) the <i>trophonius</i> form which is a close mimic of
  the common <i>Danais chrysippus</i><a name="footnotetag15"
  href="#footnote15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>. Except that <i>cenea</i> does not
  occur on the West Coast these three forms of female are found over almost
  all the great continental range of <i>dardanus</i> and its geographical
  races. Northwards in the latitude of Victoria Nyanza occurs a distinct
  form of female, <i>planemoides</i>, which bears a remarkable resemblance
  to the common and distasteful <i>Planema poggei</i>, and is found only
  where the latter is abundant. All of these four forms are close mimics of
  a common Danaine or Acraeine model. Other forms of female, however, are
  known, of which two, <i>dionysus</i> and <i>trimeni</i>, are sufficiently
  distinct and constant to have acquired special names. <i>Dionysus</i> may
  be said to unite the fore wing of the <i>hippocoon</i> form with the hind
  wing of the <i>trophonius</i> form, except that the colour of the last
  part is yellow instead of <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page32"></a>{32}</span>bright brown. It is a western form and is
  unlike any model. <i>Trimeni</i> also is unlike any model but is of
  peculiar interest in that it is much more like the male with its pale
  creamy-yellow colour and the lesser development of black scales than
  occurs in most of the forms of female. At the same time the general
  arrangement of the darker markings is on the whole similar to that in the
  <i>hippocoon</i> and in the <i>trophonius</i> form. <i>Trimeni</i> is
  found on the Kikuyu Escarpment, near Mt Kenia, along with the four
  mimicking forms.</p>

  <p>Continental Africa, south of the equator, has produced no female
  similar to the male. But in Abyssinia is found another state of things.
  Here, so far as is known, occur three forms, all tailed, of which one is
  similar in general colour and pattern to the male, while the other two,
  <i>niavioides</i> and <i>ruspina</i><a name="footnotetag16"
  href="#footnote16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>, resemble respectively a tailed
  <i>hippocoon</i> and a tailed <i>trophonius</i>. Lastly we have to record
  that <i>Papilio dardanus</i> is also found as the geographical race
  <i>humbloti</i> on Comoro Island, and as <i>meriones</i> on Madagascar.
  In both forms the females are tailed, and resemble the males.</p>

  <p>From this long series of facts it is concluded that the male of <i>P.
  dardanus</i> represents the original form of both sexes. On the islands
  of Comoro and Madagascar this state of things still survives. But it is
  supposed that on the African continent existed enemies which persecuted
  the species more than on the islands <!-- Page 33 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page33"></a>{33}</span>and encouraged the
  development of mimetic forms in the female. The original female still
  lingers in Abyssinia though it is now accompanied by the two mimetic
  forms <i>niavioides</i> and <i>ruspina</i>. Over the rest of the area
  occupied by <i>dardanus</i> the females are always tailless and, with the
  exception of <i>trimeni</i> and <i>dionysus</i>, wonderfully close
  mimics. <i>Trimeni</i>, the intermediate form, provides the clue to the
  way in which the mimetic females have been derived from the male, viz. by
  the prolongation across the fore wing of the dark costal bar already
  found in the females of the Madagascar and Abyssinian races, by the
  deepening of the dark edging to the wings, and by the loss of the tail.
  Through the gradual accumulation of small variations <i>trimeni</i> came
  from the male-like female, and by further gradual accumulation of small
  favourable variations the mimetic forms came from <i>trimeni</i>. South
  of the equator the male-like form and the intermediate <i>trimeni</i>
  have disappeared owing to the stringency of selection being greater.
  Moreover the likeness of mimic to model is closer than in the north, a
  further proof of the greater stringency of natural selection in these
  parts. Such in brief is the explanation in terms of mimicry of the
  remarkable and complex case of <i>dardanus</i>.</p>

  <p>Although the Euploeinae are not represented on the African continent,
  it is the headquarters of another distasteful family of
  butterflies&mdash;the Acraeinae&mdash;which is but sparingly represented
  in the Oriental region<a name="footnotetag17"
  href="#footnote17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>. <!-- Page 34 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page34"></a>{34}</span>Of smaller size than the
  Danaines they are characterised, like this group, by their tenacity of
  life and by the presumably distasteful character of their body juices.
  They are said also to possess an offensive odour apparently exuded
  through the thorax. The majority of the members of the group fall into
  the two genera <i>Acraea</i> and <i>Planema</i>. Species of Acraea are on
  the whole characterised by their general bright red-brown colour and by
  the conspicuous black spots on both fore and hind wings. A typical
  Acraeine pattern is that of <i>Acraea egina</i> (<a href="#plateVI">Pl.
  VI</a>, fig. 7) which is mimicked remarkably closely by the Nymphaline
  <i>Pseudacraea boisduvali</i> and by the Swallow-tail <i>Papilio
  ridleyanus</i> (<a href="#plateVI">Pl. VI</a>, figs. 5 and 6).</p>

  <p>In the genus <i>Planema</i> the spots are as a rule fewer and
  clustered near the body, while on both fore and hind wings there is a
  tendency to develop clear wide band-like areas of orange or white (cf. <a
  href="#plateVII">Pl. VII</a>).</p>

  <p>Like the Acraeas the Planemas are principally mimicked by species of
  <i>Pseudacraea</i> and of <i>Papilio</i>. Some of the cases of
  resemblance between <i>Planema</i> and <i>Pseudacraea</i> are among the
  most striking known. <i>Planema macarista</i> is one of those
  comparatively rare instances in which a model shews a marked difference
  in the pattern of the two sexes. The clear area on the fore wing of the
  male is deep orange, whereas in the female it is somewhat different in
  shape, and, like the area on the hind wing, is white (cf. <a
  href="#plateVII">Pl. VII</a>, figs. 1 and 2). <!-- Page 35 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>{35}</span><i>Pseudacraea eurytus
  hobleyi</i> (<a href="#plateVII">Pl. VII</a>, figs. 6 and 7) shews a
  similar difference in the sexes, the male and female of this species
  mimicking respectively the male and female of <i>Planema macarista</i>.
  The case is made even more remarkable by the fact that both of the sexual
  forms of <i>Planema macarista</i> are mimicked by the Satyrine
  <i>Elymnias phegea</i> (<a href="#plateVII">Pl. VII</a>, fig. 9), though
  in this species either the black and white, or the black, white, and
  orange form may occur in either sex. Among the best Papilionine mimics of
  the Planemas is <i>Papilio cynorta</i> whose female is extraordinarily
  like the common <i>Planema epaea</i> (<a href="#plateVII">Pl. VII</a>,
  figs. 5 and 10). The resemblance of the <i>planemoides</i> female of
  <i>P. dardanus</i> to <i>P. poggei</i> has already been noticed.</p>

  <p>A striking feature of the African continent is the frequency with
  which mimetic forms are found among the Lycaenidae. As a rule the "blues"
  rarely exhibit mimetic analogies, but in Africa there are several
  species, especially those of the genus <i>Mimacraea</i>, which closely
  resemble Acraeines. Others again bear a marked resemblance to certain
  small Pierines, <i>Citronophila similis</i> from S. Nigeria for example
  being extraordinarily like the common <i>Terias brigitta</i>, a small
  bright yellow Pierine with black-edged wings.</p>

  <p>A remarkable feature of the African continent is the absence of the
  Pharmacophagus Swallow-tails. Of such Papilios as exhibit mimicry, and as
  compared with the total number of the group present the proportion is
  large, the majority resemble one or other <!-- Page 36 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page36"></a>{36}</span>of the characteristic
  Danaines, while a few such as <i>P. ridleyanus</i> and <i>P. cynorta</i>
  resemble either an Acraeoid or a Planemoid model.</p>

  <p>As in the Oriental region the African Pierines do not offer many
  instances of mimetic analogies. The genus <i>Mylothris</i>, in which
  certain species are characterised by orange patches at the bases of the
  undersurfaces of the fore wings, is regarded by some authors as providing
  models for allied genera such as <i>Belenois</i> and <i>Phrissura</i>.
  But as neither models nor mimics offer a marked divergence in appearance
  from the ordinary Pierine facies it is doubtful whether much stress can
  be laid on these cases.</p>

  <p>Africa also offers a few striking instances of mimicry in which
  day-flying moths play a part. The conspicuous Geometer <i>Aletis
  helcita</i> is an abundant form, and with its strong red colour and black
  wing margins broken by white it is a striking object in the preserved
  state. Among the forms which bear a close resemblance to it are the
  Nymphaline <i>Euphaedra ruspina</i>, and the Lycaenid <i>Telipna
  sanguinea</i><a name="footnotetag18"

<h5>CHAPTER IV</h5>

<h5 class="scac">NEW-WORLD MIMICS</h5>

  <p>Of all the continents South America affords the greatest wealth of
  butterfly life, and it is in the tropical part of this region that many
  of the most beautiful and striking cases of mimicry are to be found.
  Viewed as a whole the butterfly population presents several features
  which serve to mark it off from that of the other two great tropical
  areas. In the first place the proportion of gaily coloured forms is
  higher. Bright red, yellow or fulvous brown contrasted with some deep
  shade approaching black form the dominant notes. Sombre coloured species
  are relatively scarcer than in the Oriental and African regions. In the
  second place when looking over collections from this part of the world
  one cannot help being struck by the frequency with which similar colour
  combinations occur over and over again in different as well as in the
  same groups. Now it is a simple scheme of black with an oblique scarlet
  band upon the fore wings&mdash;now an arrangement with alternating
  stripes of bright brown and black relieved with patches of clear
  yellow&mdash;now again a scheme of pure transparency and black. <!-- Page
  38 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>{38}</span>Gay and
  pleasing as are the designs turned out the palette is a small one and
  invention is circumscribed. Under such conditions it might well be
  supposed that instances of close resemblance between different species
  would be numerous, and this in effect is what we find.</p>

  <p>As in Asia with its Euploeines and Danaines, and in Africa with its
  Danaines and Acraeines, so in S. America are the fashions set by two
  dominant groups of models. These are the Heliconinae and the Ithomiinae,
  both peculiar to this region and both characterised, like the Old-world
  Danaids, by slow flight and great tenacity of life. Both live on
  poisonous plants&mdash;the Heliconines on Passifloras and the Ithomiines
  on Solanaceae. In both groups, but more especially in the Ithomiinae, the
  species are numerous, and the number of individuals in a species often
  beyond computation. From the point of view of mimicry these two groups
  have so much in common that they may conveniently be considered
  together.</p>

  <p>It was from among the Ithomiines, as already pointed out, that the
  models came for the Pierine mimics of the genus <i>Dismorphia</i> upon
  which Bates founded the theory of mimicry. Though the Pierine mimics are
  the most striking the Heliconines and Ithomiines are mimicked by members
  of other groups. A few Papilios (<a href="#plateX">Pl. X</a>, fig. 8),
  certain Nymphalines such as <i>Protogonius</i> (<a href="#plateX">Pl.
  X</a>, fig. 9), <i>Eresia</i>, <i>Phyciodes</i> and <i>Colaenis</i> (<a
  href="#plateXI">Pl. XI</a>, fig. 4), together with various day-flying
  moths, more particularly of the genera <!-- Page 39 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>{39}</span><i>Castnia</i> and
  <i>Pericopis</i>, are among the well-known mimics of this group of
  models. The models themselves are very variable in appearance. In one
  locality the predominant pattern is black with a warm red-brown diagonal
  bar occupying rather more than a third of the fore wing (<a
  href="#plateXV">Pl. XV</a>, fig. 5), in another it consists of parallel
  bands of black and fulvous brown with clear yellow patches at the tips of
  the fore wings (cf. <a href="#plateX">Pl. X</a>, fig. 7), while in yet
  another locality it is different again. Different localities often have
  their own peculiar pattern and this affects the various mimics as well as
  the Ithomiine and Heliconine models.</p>

  <p>These groups of different species, some belonging to palatable and
  some to unpalatable groups, all exhibiting a close resemblance in colour
  and pattern, are far more strikingly developed in S. America than in
  either Asia or Africa, and it is not uncommon for eight or ten species to
  enter into such an association. A group of this sort which possesses
  unusual interest is the so-called "Transparency Group" from certain parts
  of the Amazon region. It was originally described by Bates with seven
  species belonging to six different genera. To-day it is said that no less
  than 28 species of this peculiar facies are known, though some are
  excessively rare. The majority are Ithomiines, but two species of the
  Danaine genus <i>Ituna</i>, the Pierine <i>Dismorphia orise</i> (<a
  href="#plateXII">Pl. XII</a>, fig. 2), the Swallow-tail <i>Papilio
  hahneli</i>, and several species of diurnal moths belonging to different
  families (cf. <a href="#plateXII">Pl. XII</a>, fig. 4) also enter into
  the combination. <!-- Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page40"></a>{40}</span>In connection with it there is a feature of
  peculiar interest in that the transparent effect is not always produced
  in the same way. In the Ithomiines such as <i>Thyridia</i>, where there
  are normally two kinds of scales, the wider ones for the most part lose
  their pigment, become much reduced in size and take on the shape of a
  stumpy V (<a href="#plateXIV">Pl. XIV</a>, fig. 3). Also they stand out
  for the most part more or less at right angles to the wing<a
  name="footnotetag19" href="#footnote19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>, and the neck
  by which they are joined to the wing membrane is very short. The longer
  and narrow form of scales also tend to lose their pigment and become
  reduced to fine hairs. In <i>Dismorphia</i> the scales, which are of one
  sort, are also reduced in size though apparently not in number. Like the
  wider scales of the <i>Thyridia</i> they tend sometimes to project at
  right angles to the wing membrane, though not to the same extent as in
  the Ithomiine: possibly because the neck of the scale is not so short. As
  in <i>Thyridia</i> these reduced scales lose their pigment except in the
  transition region round the borders of the transparent patches. In
  <i>Ituna</i> there is a difference. The scales are not reduced to the
  same extent in point of size. Their necks are longer as in normal scales
  and they lie flat on the wing membrane. The majority of the scales, as in
  the preceding cases, lose their pigment, but mixed up with them is a
  certain proportion, about one-quarter, <!-- Page 41 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page41"></a>{41}</span>in which the pigment is
  retained. In <i>Castnia</i> and in <i>Anthomysa</i> the scales on the
  transparent parts which are without pigment are also somewhat reduced in
  size, being stumpier than the normal ones. At the same time they tend to
  stand out at right angles to the wing membrane<a name="footnotetag20"
  href="#footnote20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>. The neck here again is shorter in
  the transparent than in the pigmented scales. A good deal of stress has
  been laid upon this case by some supporters of the theory of mimicry,
  since it is supposed to shew that a similar effect can be brought about
  in a variety of ways; consequently the existence of this assembly of
  similar transparent forms belonging to various families cannot be put
  down as due to the effect of similar conditions, but must be regarded as
  having arisen in each instance in a different manner through the
  independent action of natural selection<a name="footnotetag21"
  href="#footnote21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>. It is doubtful, however, whether
  such a conclusion necessarily follows from the facts. In all of the cases
  the process would appear to be similar: loss of pigment, reduction in the
  size of the scales, and eventually a tendency for the scales to stand at
  right angles to the wing&mdash;this last part of the process apparently
  depending upon the reduction of the neck of the scale. It has been said
  that greater transparency is brought about by the scales standing out at
  right angles in this way, but as the scales <!-- Page 42 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>{42}</span>themselves are already
  transparent there would appear to be no reason why this should be so. Of
  course the process has not proceeded in all of the forms to the same
  extent. There is least change in <i>Ituna</i> where the scales are not
  much reduced in size and where a fair proportion are still pigmented.
  There is probably most in an Ithomiine such as <i>Thyridia</i>, where the
  scales are not only small and entirely without pigment, but also are for
  the most part neckless so that they stand out at right angles to the
  wing. Having regard to the fact that several widely separate genera with
  different types of scaling formed the starting points, the final results
  do not seem to preclude the supposition that the transparency has arisen
  through a similar process in all of them.</p>

  <p>It is somewhat remarkable that no Satyrine exhibits mimicry in S.
  America, in spite of the fact that transparency of the wings, as in so
  many of the butterflies of this region, is quite common in the group. On
  the other hand the relatively large number of more or less mimetic
  Pierines is a striking feature of S. America. For the most part they
  belong to the genera <i>Dismorphia</i> and <i>Perrhybris</i>, and
  resemble the yellow, black, and brown Heliconines and Ithomiines, though
  some of the former genus are mimics of the small transparent Ithomiines.
  Some of the species of <i>Pereute</i> with their dark ground colour and
  the bright red bar across the fore wing (<a href="#plateXI">Pl. XI</a>,
  fig. 6) resemble <i>Heliconius melpomene</i>, as also does <i>Papilio
  euterpinus</i>. But some of the most interesting Pierine <!-- Page 43
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"></a>{43}</span>mimics are
  several forms belonging to the genus <i>Archonias</i> (<a
  href="#plateXI">Pl. XI</a>, fig. 10) which exhibit the simple and
  striking arrangement of black, red and white so characteristic of the
  Swallow-tail Poison-eaters of S. America. They form one of the rare
  instances of a Pharmacophagus Papilio being mimicked by a butterfly which
  does not belong to the Swallow-tail group.</p>

  <p>As everywhere in the tropics the Papilios of S. America supply a
  goodly proportion of the mimicry cases. A few, such as <i>P. zagreus</i>
  (<a href="#plateX">Pl. X</a>, fig. 8), enter into the black-brown and
  yellow Ithomiine-Heliconine combination; <i>P. euterpinus</i> resembles
  <i>Heliconius melpomene</i> (<a href="#plateXI">Pl. XI</a>, fig. 5);
  <i>P. pausanias</i> is like <i>Heliconius sulphurea</i> (<a
  href="#plateXI">Pl. XI</a>, figs. 1 and 2). But this practically exhausts
  the list of Papilios which mimic Heliconines and Ithomiines. The great
  majority of mimicking Swallow-tails in S. America find their models among
  the Poison-eaters of their own family, offering in this respect a
  contrast to those of Asia where the majority of models are among the
  Danaines and Euploeines, and of Africa where they are exclusively
  Acraeines or Danaines.</p>

  <p>The Poison-eaters of S. America fall into two well-marked groups which
  we may call the red-spotted and the dark green groups respectively. The
  red spotted group form a remarkably compact and uniform assemblage. The
  general ground colour is a deep black-brown (<a href="#plateXI">Pl.
  XI</a>, figs. 8 and 9), the hind wings are almost invariably marked with
  red near the centre or towards the outer margin, and the fore wing may
  <!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"></a>{44}</span>or
  may not bear a patch which is generally whitish in the female, though
  often of a brilliant blue or green in the male. This simple colour scheme
  with variations runs throughout about three-quarters (some 40 species) of
  the Poison-eaters. The same general colour scheme is also found in about
  two dozen species of the unprotected Swallow-tails. As the total number
  of the unprotected species is placed by Seitz at less than 100 this means
  that fully one-quarter of them fall into the general colour scheme
  adopted by the majority of the Poison-eaters. In many cases the
  resemblance between mimic and model is so close as to have deceived the
  most expert entomologists before the structural differences between the
  groups had been appreciated (cf. Appendix II). The matter is further
  complicated by the fact that polymorphism is not uncommon, especially
  among the females of the mimetic forms. <i>Papilio lysithous</i> for
  instance has no less than six distinct forms of female, which differ
  chiefly in the extent and arrangement of the white markings on the wings,
  one form lacking them entirely. Several of these forms may occur together
  in a given locality, and may resemble as many distinct species of
  Poison-eaters. Thus the three forms <i>lysithous</i>, with white on both
  wings, <i>rurik</i>, with white on the fore wing only, and
  <i>pomponius</i> without any white, all fly together in Rio Grande do Sul
  and respectively mimic the three distinct Pharmacophagus species
  <i>nephalion</i>, <i>chamissonia</i>, and <i>perrhebus</i> (<a
  href="#plateXIII">Pl. XIII</a>). It is worthy of note that mimics are
  provided by both unprotected <!-- Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page45"></a>{45}</span>groups of Swallow-tails in S. America,
  whereas in Asia the Cosmodesmus division never provides mimics for
  Pharmacophagus models (cf. Appendix II).</p>

  <p>In the second and smaller group of the Pharmacophagus Swallow-tails
  the general colour scheme is a more or less dark metallic blue-green with
  a tendency towards the obliteration of light markings. Some idea of their
  appearance may be got from the figure of the Central and N. American
  <i>P. philenor</i> on <a href="#plateXVI">Pl. XVI</a>, fig. 1. Though one
  or two unprotected Papilios in S. America fall more or less into this
  colour scheme, the group, from the point of view of mimicry, is not
  nearly so important as the red-spotted one.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless the blue-green Pharmacophagus group as represented by
  <i>P. philenor</i> is supposed to play a considerable part in mimicry in
  N. America. <i>P. philenor</i> is found throughout the greater part of
  the Eastern United States, straggling up as far as the Canadian border.
  On the west it is also found reaching up to North California. Over
  considerable parts of its range are three other Swallow-tails, belonging
  to the unprotected Papilios, which are regarded by Professor Poulton and
  others as mimics of <i>philenor</i><a name="footnotetag22"
  href="#footnote22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>. One of these, <i>P. troilus</i>,
  is dark brown with a dusting of blue scales over the hind wing (<a
  href="#plateXVI">Pl. XVI</a>, fig. 2). The sexes here are more or less
  alike. <i>Troilus</i> stretches up into North-west Canada some way beyond
  the limits reached by its model. <i>P. glaucus</i> is a black and yellow
  Swallow-tail with two forms of female. <!-- Page 46 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page46"></a>{46}</span>One of these resembles
  the male while the other is darker and is said to mimic <i>philenor</i>.
  It is known as the <i>turnus</i> form and is found more commonly in the
  southern part of the range of the species, <i>i.e.</i> in the country
  where <i>philenor</i> is more plentiful. The third species, <i>P.
  asterius</i>, has a more southerly distribution. Its female is darker and
  nearer to <i>philenor</i> than the male. It must, however, be admitted
  that none of the three species bears a very close resemblance to
  <i>philenor</i>. It is suggested that this is because <i>P. philenor</i>
  is a tropical form which has only recently invaded N. America. The
  crossing of <i>philenor</i> has, as it were, induced the three mimicking
  <i>Papilios</i> to turn dark, but the model has not been long enough in
  contact with them for the likeness to become a close one. The
  explanation, however, hardly accounts for the fact that the best mimic of
  the three, <i>P. troilus</i>, in which both sexes are dark, is found far
  north of <i>philenor</i>. Either the dark colour was established without
  the influence of the Pharmacophagus model, or else the species rapidly
  extended its range northwards after having been modified under the
  influence of <i>philenor</i> in the south. But in that case the critic
  may ask why it does not revert to the original pattern now that it has
  got beyond the model's sphere of influence. On the whole it seems at
  present quite doubtful whether any relation of a mimetic nature exists
  between <i>P. philenor</i> and these three species of <i>Papilio</i>.</p>

  <p><i>P. philenor</i> is also regarded as serving as a model <!-- Page 47
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"></a>{47}</span>for two
  Nymphaline butterflies in the United States. One of these is the large
  Fritillary <i>Argynnis diana</i> of which the dark female has a markedly
  blue tint on the upper surface (<a href="#plateXVI">Pl. XVI</a>, fig. 3).
  The other is a <i>Limenitis</i><a name="footnotetag23"
  href="#footnote23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> related to our own White Admiral.
  This form, <i>L. astyanax</i> (<a href="#plateXVI">Pl. XVI</a>, fig. 5),
  is a dark form with a bluish iridescence on the upper surface. It is
  found, like <i>P. philenor</i>, over the greater part of the Eastern
  States, while to the north, near the Canadian boundary, its place is
  taken by <i>L. arthemis</i> with prominent white bar across both wings
  (<a href="#plateXVI">Pl. XVI</a>, fig. 4). There is reason for believing
  that where the two overlap there is occasional inbreeding, and that the
  hybrid is the form known as <i>proserpina</i>, resembling <i>astyanax</i>
  more than <i>arthemis</i>. It must be admitted that in general appearance
  <i>L. astyanax</i> and <i>Argynnis diana</i> are more like <i>Papilio
  troilus</i> than <i>P. philenor</i>. In explanation it has been suggested
  that all the mimics are on the way to resembling <i>P. philenor</i>, and
  consequently we should expect them at certain stages to shew more
  resemblance to one another than to the form they have all as it were set
  out to mimic. On this view they will all arrive at a close resemblance to
  <i>philenor</i> in time. Another explanation is that favoured by
  Professor Poulton on which it is assumed that we are here dealing with a
  case of Müllerian Mimicry, all of the species in question being
  distasteful with the exception perhaps of <i>A. diana</i>. Thus
  <i>troilus</i> and <i>astyanax</i> though distasteful are less so than
  <!-- Page 48 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page48"></a>{48}</span><i>philenor</i>. Hence it is of advantage to
  them to have even a chance of being mistaken for the more obnoxious
  <i>philenor</i>, and so the one has come from the black and yellow
  Swallow-tail pattern and the other from the white-banded <i>arthemis</i>
  form to what they are, <i>i.e.</i> more alike to one another than to
  <i>philenor</i>. They now form a Müllerian combination for mutual
  protection along with the dark females of <i>glaucus</i> and
  <i>asterius</i>. But they are themselves still moderately distasteful so
  that it is to the advantage of the female of <i>Argynnis diana</i> to
  mimic them. Whether they are all on the way to resembling <i>philenor</i>
  more closely, or whether they have sufficiently vindicated their inedible
  properties and are now stationary, it is for the future to reveal to
  posterity. Lastly we have the view that these different species have
  attained their present coloration entirely independently of one another,
  and that we are not here concerned with mimicry at all. Since the sole
  evidence available at present is that based on general appearance and
  geographical distribution, the view taken of this case must rest largely
  upon personal inclination.</p>

  <p>Though the cases just quoted are only very problematically mimetic, N.
  America has yet several examples of resemblance between distantly related
  forms as close as any that occur in the tropics. In this region are found
  two species of the genus <i>Danais</i>&mdash;<i>D. archippus</i>
  occurring all over the United States and reaching up northwards into
  Canada, <i>D. berenice</i> found in the South-eastern States, <i>e.g.</i>
  in Florida, where it is said to be more abundant than <i>archippus</i>.
  <!-- Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page49"></a>{49}</span><i>D. archippus</i> (<a href="#plateXVI">Pl.
  XVI</a>, fig. 8) is very similar to the oriental <i>D. plexippus</i> (<a
  href="#plateIV">Pl. IV</a>, fig. 2), from which perhaps its most notable
  difference lies in the extent and arrangement of the white spots near the
  tip of the fore wing. <i>D. berenice</i> is not unlike <i>archippus</i>
  in its general colour scheme but is smaller and darker (<a
  href="#plateXVI">Pl. XVI</a>, fig. 9).</p>

  <p>We have already had occasion to mention the common Nymphaline,
  <i>Limenitis arthemis</i> (<a href="#plateXVI">Pl. XVI</a>, fig. 4) which
  is found in Canada and the Northeastern States. Widely spread over N.
  America is a close ally of this species, <i>L. archippus</i>, which,
  though so similar in structure and habits, is very different in external
  appearance. As appears from <a href="#plateXVI">Pl. XVI</a>, fig. 6,
  <i>L. archippus</i> is remarkably like the Danaid which bears the same
  specific name. In the Southern States <i>L. archippus</i> is replaced by
  a form slightly different in details of pattern and distinctly darker,
  <i>L. floridensis</i> (= <i>eros</i>) (<a href="#plateXVI">Pl. XVI</a>,
  fig. 7). In Florida occurs also the darker N. American Danaid, <i>D.
  berenice</i>, to which the colour of <i>L. floridensis</i> approximates
  more than to <i>D. archippus</i>, and it is of interest that although the
  last named is also found in this locality it is said to be much less
  abundant than <i>D. berenice</i>. Nevertheless it appears to be true that
  the range of <i>L. floridensis</i> is much more extensive than that of
  its model; in other words, that there are considerable regions where
  <i>L. floridensis</i> and <i>D. archippus</i> coexist, and from which
  <i>L. archippus</i> and <i>D. berenice</i> are wanting.</p>

<h5>CHAPTER V</h5>

<h5 class="scac">SOME CRITICISMS</h5>

  <p>The facts related in the last two chapters are sufficient to make it
  clear that these remarkable resemblances between species belonging as a
  rule to widely different groups constitute a real phenomenon, and as such
  demand an explanation. One explanation, that in terms of the theory of
  mimicry, has already been outlined, and we may now turn to consider it in
  more detail. Some years ago Wallace<a name="footnotetag24"
  href="#footnote24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>, combating the suggestion that
  these instances of resemblance might be mere coincidences, laid down five
  conditions which he stated were applicable to all such cases, and
  rendered utterly inadequate any explanation other than in terms of
  natural selection. These five conditions are of historical interest and
  may also serve as a peg for sundry criticisms in connection with the
  mimicry theory. They are as follows:</p>

  <p>(1) That the imitative species occur in the same area and occupy the
  very same station as the imitated.</p>

  <p>(2) That the imitators are always the more defenceless. <!-- Page 51
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>{51}</span></p>

  <p>(3) That the imitators are always less numerous in individuals.</p>

  <p>(4) That the imitators differ from the bulk of their allies.</p>

  <p>(5) That the imitation, however minute, is <i>external</i> and
  <i>visible</i> only, never extending to internal characters or to such as
  do not affect the external appearance.</p>

  <p>In offering certain criticisms of the mimicry explanation it will be
  convenient to do so in connection with these five conditions which
  Wallace regarded as constant for all cases of mimetic resemblance.</p>

<h5>(1) <i>That the imitative species occur in the same
area and occupy the very same station as the imitated.</i></h5>

  <p>This on the whole is generally true. It is well shewn in some of the
  most striking cases such as those of the Old-World Papilios that mimic
  Danaines, or of the Dismorphias and their Ithomiine models. In many of
  these cases the range of neither model nor mimic is a very wide one, yet
  the mimic is found strictly inside the area inhabited by the model.
  <i>Papilio agestor</i>, for instance, is only found where <i>Caduga
  tytia</i> occurs, nor is <i>P. mendax</i> known outside the area
  frequented by <i>Euploea rhadamanthus</i>. Even more striking in this
  respect are some of the Ithomiine-Dismorphia resemblances in the New
  World. The Ithomiine models are as a rule very local though very
  abundant. Two hundred miles away the predominant Ithomiine often bears
  quite a distinct pattern, and when this is the case the mimicking
  <i>Dismorphia</i> is generally changed in the same sense. <!-- Page 52
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>{52}</span>But though mimic
  and model may be found together in the same locality, they do not always
  occupy the same station in the sense that they fly together. According to
  Seitz<a name="footnotetag25" href="#footnote25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> the
  Dismorphias themselves do not fly with the Ithomiines which they mimic.
  The occurrence of butterflies is largely conditioned by the occurrence of
  the plants on which the larva feeds, and this is especially true of the
  female, which, as has already been noticed, is more commonly mimetic than
  the male. The female of <i>Papilio polytes</i>, for instance, is found
  flying where are to be found the wild citronaceous plants on which its
  larva feeds. On the other hand, its so-called models, <i>Papilio
  hector</i> and <i>P. aristolochiae</i>, are generally in the proximity of
  the Aristolochias on which their larvae feed. The two plants are not
  always found together, so that one frequently comes across areas where
  <i>P. polytes</i> is very abundant while the models are scarce or
  absent.</p>

  <p>Though in the great majority of cases the imitator and the imitated
  occur in the same locality, this is not always so. The female of the
  Fritillary <i>Argynnis hyperbius</i> (<a href="#plateIV">Pl. IV</a>, fig.
  3), for instance, is exceedingly difficult to distinguish from <i>Danais
  plexippus</i> when flying, although when at rest the difference between
  the two is sufficiently obvious. Both insects are plentiful in Ceylon but
  inhabit different stations. The Danaid is a low-country insect, while the
  Fritillary is not found until several thousand feet up. The two species
  affect entirely different stations and hardly <!-- Page 53 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page53"></a>{53}</span>come into contact with
  each other. Where one is plentiful the other is not found. It has been
  suggested that migratory birds may have come into play in such cases. The
  bird learns in the low country that <i>D. plexippus</i> is unpleasant,
  and when it pays a visit to the hills it takes this experience with it
  and avoids those females of the Fritillary which recall the unpleasant
  Danaine.</p>

  <p>Migratory birds have also been appealed to in another case where the
  resembling species are even further removed from one another than in the
  last case. <i>Hypolimnas misippus</i> is common and widely spread over
  Africa and Indo-Malaya, and the male (<a href="#plateIV">Pl. IV</a>, fig.
  8) bears a simple and conspicuous pattern&mdash;a large white spot
  bordered with purple on each of the very dark fore and hind wings. The
  same pattern occurs in the males of two other Nymphalines allied to <i>H.
  misippus</i>, viz. <i>Athyma punctata</i> and <i>Limenitis
  albomaculata</i>. The two species, however, have a distribution quite
  distinct from that of <i>H. misippus</i>, being found in China. It has
  nevertheless been suggested by Professor Poulton<a name="footnotetag26"
  href="#footnote26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> that the case may yet be one of
  mimicry. According to his explanation, <i>H. misippus</i> is unpalatable,
  the well-known association of its female with <i>Danais chrysippus</i>
  being an instance of Müllerian mimicry. Migratory birds did the rest.
  Having had experience of <i>H. misippus</i> in the south, on their
  arrival in China they spared such specimens of <i>Athyma punctata</i> and
  <i>Limenitis</i> <!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page54"></a>{54}</span><i>albomaculata</i> as approached most
  nearly to <i>H. misippus</i> in pattern, and so brought about the
  resemblance. The explanation is ingenious, but a simpler view will
  probably commend itself to most. Other cases are known in which two
  butterflies bear a close resemblance in pattern and yet are widely
  separated geographically. Several species of the S. American Vanessid
  genus <i>Adelpha</i> are in colour scheme like the African <i>Planema
  poggei</i> which serves as a model for more than one species. The little
  S. American <i>Phyciodes leucodesma</i> would almost certainly be
  regarded either as a model for or a mimic of the African <i>Neptis
  nemetes</i>, did the two occur together. Nevertheless examples of close
  resemblance between butterflies which live in different parts of the
  world are relatively rare and serve to emphasise the fact that the great
  bulk of these resemblance cases are found associated in pairs or in
  little groups.</p>

<h5>(2) <i>That the imitators are always the more defenceless.</i></h5>

  <p>In the case of butterflies "defence" as a rule denotes a disagreeable
  flavour rendering its possessor distasteful to birds and perhaps to other
  would-be devourers. Feeding experiments with birds (cf. Chapter IX)
  suggest that certain groups of butterflies, notably the Danaines,
  Acraeines, Heliconines, Ithomiines and Pharmacophagus
  Papilios&mdash;groups from which models are generally drawn&mdash;are
  characterised by a disagreeable taste, while as a rule this is not true
  for the mimics. This distasteful quality is frequently accompanied by a
  more or less conspicuous type of coloration, <!-- Page 55 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page55"></a>{55}</span>though this is by no
  means always so. Many Euploeas are sombre inconspicuous forms, and it is
  only some of the Ithomiines that sport the gay colours with which that
  group is generally associated. The members of the distasteful groups
  usually present certain other peculiarities. Their flight is slower, they
  are less wary, their bodies are far tougher, and they are more tenacious
  of life. The slow flight is regarded as an adaptation for exhibiting the
  warning coloration to the best advantage, but from the point of view of
  utility it is plausible to suggest that the insect would be better off if
  in addition to its warning coloration it possessed also the power of
  swift flight<a name="footnotetag27"
  href="#footnote27"><sup>[27]</sup></a>. It is possible that the peculiar
  slowness of flight of these unpalatable groups is necessitated by the
  peculiar tough but elastic integument which may present an insufficiently
  firm and resistant skeletal basis for sharp powerful muscular
  contraction, and so render swift flight impossible. It is stated that the
  flight of the mimics is like that of the model, and in some cases this is
  undoubtedly true. But in a great many cases it certainly does not hold
  good. <i>Papilio clytia</i> (<a href="#plateI">Pl. I</a>, figs. 7 and 8)
  is a strong swift flyer very unlike the Danaine and Euploeine which it is
  supposed to mimic. The flight of the female of <i>Hypolimnas misippus</i>
  (<a href="#plateIV">Pl. IV</a>, fig. 7) is quite distinct from that of
  <i>Danais chrysippus</i>, while the mimetic <!-- Page 56 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>{56}</span>forms of <i>P.
  polytes</i> fly like the non-mimetic one, a mode of flight so different
  from that of the two models that there is no difficulty in distinguishing
  them many yards away. Swift flight must be reckoned as one of the chief
  modes of defence in a butterfly, and on this score the mimic is often
  better off than the model. And of course it must not be forgotten that
  where the mode of flight is distinct the protective value of the
  resemblance must be very much discounted.</p>

<h5>(3) <i>That the imitators are always less numerous
in individuals.</i></h5>

  <p>In the majority of cases this is certainly true. Probably all the
  Old-World Papilios that mimic Danaines are scarcer, and frequently very
  much scarcer, than their models. This is very evident from a study of the
  more comprehensive priced catalogues of Lepidoptera. The mimic is
  generally a more expensive insect than the model, and not infrequently it
  costs as many pounds as the model does shillings. But the rule is not
  universal. <i>Papilio polytes</i> is often much more common than either
  of its models. The remarkable Pierines, <i>Archonias tereas</i> and <i>A.
  critias</i> (<a href="#plateXI">Pl. XI</a>, fig. 10) as a rule far
  outnumber the Pharmacophagus Swallow-tail which they mimic. Or again the
  Chalcosid moth <i>Callamesia pieridoides</i><a name="footnotetag28"
  href="#footnote28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> is a more abundant insect than the
  Bornean Pierine <i>Delias cathara</i> which it closely resembles.</p>

  <p>It has sometimes been suggested in explanation <!-- Page 57 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page57"></a>{57}</span>of the greater abundance
  of the mimic that in such cases we are concerned with Müllerian mimicry,
  that since both of the species concerned are distasteful there is not,
  strictly speaking, either a mimic or a model, and consequently the
  relative proportions have not the significance that they possess where
  the mimicry is of the simple Batesian type. It is, however, very doubtful
  whether such an explanation is of any value, for, as will appear later,
  there are grave objections to accepting the current theory as to the way
  in which a resemblance is established on Müllerian lines (cf. pp. <a
  href="#page72">72</a>-<a href="#page74">74</a>).</p>

<h5>(4) <i>That the imitators differ from the bulk of their
allies.</i></h5>

  <p>What importance we attach to this condition must depend upon our
  interpretation of the word "allies"&mdash;whether, for example, we use it
  for a small group of closely connected species, for a genus, for a group
  of genera, or in an even wider sense. Perhaps an example will serve to
  make the difficulty more clear. As already noticed, the S. American genus
  <i>Dismorphia</i> belongs to the family of Pieridae or "whites." Also
  certain species of <i>Dismorphia</i> bear a close resemblance to certain
  species of Ithomiines, a noteworthy example being <i>D. praxinoe</i> and
  <i>Mechanitis saturata</i> (<a href="#plateX">Pl. X</a>, figs. 3 and 7),
  in which the pattern, colour, and shape of the two species are all far
  removed from what is usually understood by a "white." It must not be
  forgotten, however, that these matters are generally discussed by
  European <!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page58"></a>{58}</span>naturalists who have grown up in a region
  where the majority of the "whites" are more or less white. For this
  reason the statement that <i>D. praxinoe</i> differs from the bulk of its
  allies is likely to meet with general acceptance, especially as some of
  the species of the genus itself (e.g., <i>D. cretacea</i>, <a
  href="#plateX">Pl. X</a>, fig. 1) are regular whites in appearance. But
  when we come to look at the genus <i>Dismorphia</i> as a whole the matter
  assumes another complexion. Seitz<a name="footnotetag29"
  href="#footnote29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> recognises 75 species of which
  about a dozen are predominantly white. The rest present a wonderful
  diversity of colour and pattern. Black predominates on the fore wings,
  and the insect is frequently marked with gay patches of yellow, bright
  brown, scarlet, or blue. Forms which from their colour are clearly not
  mimics present nevertheless the general pattern and shape of other forms
  which bear a strong resemblance to some Ithomiine. Sometimes a change of
  colour in certain patches from blue or yellow to bright brown would make
  all the difference between a non-imitative and an imitative species.
  Moreover, the non-imitative forms frequently have the peculiar narrow
  wing, so unusual in a Pierine, which enhances the resemblance of the
  mimicking species to the Ithomiine model, and which to some extent occurs
  even in <i>D. cretacea</i>. Clearly we are not justified in saying that
  <i>D. praxinoe</i> differs from the bulk of its allies, for inside the
  genus there are many non-imitative species which differ <!-- Page 59
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"></a>{59}</span>from it in some
  particulars and are alike it in others. There is a distinct family
  resemblance among the bulk of the Dismorphias, including practically all
  the mimetic forms, and on the whole the resemblances between the
  imitative and the non-imitative forms are as noteworthy as the
  differences. Though not exhibited in so striking a fashion, the same is
  to a large extent true of a large proportion of the cases of mimicry. It
  is on the whole unusual to find cases where a single species departs
  widely from the pattern scheme of the other members of the genus and at
  the same time resembles an unrelated species. Two of the best instances
  are perhaps those of <i>Limenitis archippus</i> (p. <a
  href="#page49">49</a>) and of the Pierid <i>Pareronia</i> (p. <a
  href="#page23">23</a>). Of the total number of mimicry instances a high
  proportion is supplied by relatively few groups. In each region several
  main series of models and mimics run as it were parallel to one another.
  In Asia, for example, we have the Papilio-Danaine series where the
  colour-patterns of a series of Danaines, all nearly related, are closely
  paralleled by those of a section of the genus <i>Papilio</i>, and by
  those of the Satyrid genus <i>Elymnias</i>. In Africa there is a similar
  Papilio-Danaine series though of less extent. Africa has a group of
  models not found in Asia, and the Papilio-Danaine series is as it were
  curtailed by the Papilio-Planema series with which to some extent runs
  parallel the genus <i>Pseudacraea</i>. These phenomena of parallel series
  have been mentioned here as shewing that mimicry tends to run in certain
  groups and that in many cases at <!-- Page 60 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page60"></a>{60}</span>any rate little meaning can be attached to
  the statement that the imitators differ from the bulk of their
  allies.</p>

  <p>The fifth of Wallace's conditions is clear and needs no
  discussion.</p>

  <p>It is evident that at any rate a large proportion of the instances of
  close resemblance do not fulfil all of the conditions laid down by
  Wallace. Nevertheless we should expect them to do so if the resemblance
  has been brought about by the cumulative effect of natural selection on
  small favourable variations. Clearly there is a <i>prima facie</i> case
  for doubting whether we must of necessity ascribe all resemblance of the
  kind to natural selection, and in the next few chapters we shall discuss
  it in more detail from several points of view.</p>

<h5>CHAPTER VI</h5>

<h5 class="scac">"MIMICRY RINGS"</h5>

  <p>Having reviewed briefly some of the most striking phenomena of what
  has been termed mimicry, we may now inquire whether there are good
  grounds for supposing that these resemblances have been brought about
  through the operation of natural selection or whether they are due to
  some other cause. If we propose to offer an explanation in terms of
  natural selection we are thereby committed to the view that these
  resemblances are of the nature of adaptation. For unless we grant this we
  cannot suppose that natural selection has had anything to do either with
  their origin or with their survival. Granting then for the present the
  adaptational nature of these mimetic resemblances, we may attempt to
  deduce from them what we can as to the mode of operation of natural
  selection. In doing so we shall bear in mind what may be called the two
  extreme views: viz. (<i>a</i>) that the resemblance has been brought
  about through the gradual accumulation of very numerous small variations
  in the right direction through the operation of natural selection, and
  (<i>b</i>) that the mimetic form came into being as a sudden sport or
  <!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page62"></a>{62}</span>mutation, and that natural selection is
  responsible merely for its survival and the elimination of the less
  favoured form from which it sprang.</p>

  <p>There is a serious difficulty in the way of accepting the former of
  these two views. If our two species, model and would-be mimic are, to
  begin with, markedly different in pattern, how can we suppose that a
  slight variation in the direction of the model on the part of the latter
  would be of any value to it? Take for example a well-known South American
  case&mdash;the resemblance between the yellow, black, and brown
  Ithomiine, <i>Mechanitis saturata</i> (<a href="#plateX">Pl. X</a>, fig.
  7) and the Pierine, <i>Dismorphia praxinoe</i> (<a href="#plateX">Pl.
  X</a>, fig. 3). The latter belongs to the family of the "whites," and
  entomologists consider that in all probability its ancestral garb was
  white with a little black like the closely allied species <i>D.
  cretacea</i> (<a href="#plateX">Pl. X</a>, fig. 1). Can we suppose that
  in such a case a small development of brown and black on the wings would
  be sufficient to recall the Ithomiine and so be of service to the
  <i>Dismorphia</i> which possessed it? Such a relatively slight approach
  to the Ithomiine colouring is shewn by the males of certain South
  American "whites" belonging to the genus <i>Perrhybris</i> (<a
  href="#plateX">Pl. X</a>, figs. 4 and 5). But the colour is confined to
  the under-surface and the butterflies possessing it could hardly be
  confused with a <i>Mechanitis</i> more than their white relations which
  entirely lack such a patch of colour. If birds regarded white butterflies
  as edible it is difficult to suppose that they would be checked in their
  attacks <!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page63"></a>{63}</span>by a trifling patch of colour while the main
  ground of the insect was still white. But unless they avoided those with
  the small colour patch there would be an end of natural selection in so
  far as the patch was concerned, and it would have no opportunity of
  developing further through the operation of that factor. This is the
  difficulty of the initial variation which has been clearly recognised by
  most of the best known supporters of the theory of mimicry. Bates himself
  offered no suggestion as to the way in which such a form as a Pierid
  could be conceived of as beginning to resemble an Ithomiine<a
  name="footnotetag30" href="#footnote30"><sup>[30]</sup></a>. Wallace
  supposed that the Ithomiines were to start with not so distinct from many
  of the edible forms as they are to-day, and that some of the Pierines
  inhabiting the same district happened to be sufficiently like some of the
  unpalatable forms to be mistaken for them occasionally<a
  name="footnotetag31" href="#footnote31"><sup>[31]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The difficulty of the initial variation had also occurred to Darwin,
  and he discusses it in an interesting passage which is so important that
  we may quote it here in full:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>It should be observed that the process of imitation probably never
  commenced between forms widely dissimilar in colour. But starting with
  species already somewhat like each other, the closest resemblance, if
  beneficial, could readily be gained by the above means; and if the
  imitated form was subsequently and gradually <!-- Page 64 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page64"></a>{64}</span>modified through any
  agency, the imitating form would be led along the same track, and thus be
  altered to almost any extent, so that it might ultimately assume an
  appearance or colouring wholly unlike that of the other members of the
  family to which it belonged. There is, however, some difficulty on this
  head, for it is necessary to suppose in some cases that ancient members
  belonging to several distinct groups, before they had diverged to their
  present extent, accidentally resembled a member of another and protected
  group in a sufficient degree to afford some slight protection; this
  having given the basis for the subsequent acquisition of the most perfect
  resemblance<a name="footnotetag32"
  href="#footnote32"><sup>[32]</sup></a>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Both Darwin and Wallace recognised clearly this difficulty of the
  initial variations, and both suggested a means of getting over it on
  similar lines. Both supposed that in general colour and pattern the
  groups to which model and mimic belonged were far more alike originally
  than they are to-day. They were in fact so much alike that comparatively
  small variations in a favourable direction on the part of the mimic would
  lead to its being confused with the unpalatable model. Then as the model
  became more and more conspicuously coloured, as it developed a more and
  more striking pattern warning would-be enemies of its unpleasant taste,
  the mimic gradually kept pace with it through the operation of natural
  selection, in the shape of the discriminating enemy, eliminating those
  most unlike the model. The mimic travelled closely in the wake of the
  model, coaxed as it were by natural selection, till at last it was far
  removed in general appearance from the great majority of its near
  relations. <!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page65"></a>{65}</span></p>

  <p>In this way was offered a comparatively simple method of getting over
  the difficulty of applying the principle of natural selection to the
  initial variations in a mimetic approach on the part of one species to
  another. But it did not escape Darwin's penetration that such an argument
  would not always be easy of application&mdash;that there might be cases
  where a given model was mimicked by members of several groups of widely
  differing ancestral pattern, and that in these cases it would be
  difficult to conceive of members of each of the several groups shewing
  simultaneous variations which would render them liable to be mistaken for
  the protected model. The difficulty may perhaps be best illustrated if we
  consider a definite case.</p>

  <p>It is a feature of mimetic resemblances among butterflies that a given
  species in a given locality may serve as a model for several other
  species belonging to unrelated groups. Generally such mimics belong to
  presumably palatable species, but other presumably unpalatable species
  may also exhibit a similar coloration and pattern. In this way is formed
  a combine to which the term "mimicry ring" has sometimes been applied. An
  excellent example of such a mimicry ring is afforded by certain species
  of butterflies in Ceylon, and is illustrated on <a href="#plateIV">Plate
  IV</a>. It is made up in the first place of two species belonging to the
  presumably distasteful Danaine group, viz. <i>Danais chrysippus</i> and
  <i>D. plexippus</i>. The latter is a rather darker insect but presents an
  unmistakable general likeness to <i>D. chrysippus</i>. Those who believe
  in <!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page66"></a>{66}</span>Müllerian mimicry would regard it as an
  excellent example of that phenomenon. For those who believe only in
  Batesian mimicry <i>D. plexippus</i>, being the scarcer insect, must be
  regarded as the mimic and <i>D. chrysippus</i> as the model. In both of
  these species the sexes are similar, whereas in the other three members
  of the "ring" the female alone exhibits the resemblance. One of these
  three species is the common Nymphaline, <i>Hypolimnas misippus</i>, of
  which the female bears an extraordinary likeness to <i>D. chrysippus</i>
  when set and pinned out on cork in the ordinary way. The male, however
  (<a href="#plateIV">Pl. IV</a>, fig. 8), is an insect of totally
  different appearance. The upper surfaces of the wings are velvety black
  with a large white patch bordered with purple in the middle of each<a
  name="footnotetag33" href="#footnote33"><sup>[33]</sup></a>. The "ring"
  is completed by the females of <i>Elymnias undularis</i> and <i>Argynnis
  hyperbius</i>. The former of these belongs to the group of Satyrine
  butterflies and the female is usually regarded as a mimic of <i>D.
  plexippus</i>, which it is not unlike in so far as the upper surface of
  the wings is concerned. Here again the male is an insect of totally
  dissimilar appearance. Except for a border of lighter brown along the
  outer edges of the hind wings the upper surface is of a uniform deep
  purple-brown <!-- Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page67"></a>{67}</span>all over (<a href="#plateIV">Pl. IV</a>,
  fig. 6). In <i>Argynnis hyperbius</i> the appearance is in general that
  of the Fritillary group to which it belongs. But in the female the outer
  portion of the fore wings exhibits much black pigment and is crossed by a
  broad white band similar to that found in the same position on the wing
  of <i>D. plexippus</i> (<a href="#plateIV">Pl. IV</a>, fig. 2).</p>

  <p>Of the five species constituting this little "mimicry ring" in Ceylon
  two, on the current theory of mimicry, are to be regarded as definitely
  unpalatable, one (<i>H. misippus</i>) as doubtfully so, while the
  Satyrine and the Fritillary are evidently examples of simple or Batesian
  mimicry.</p>

  <p>Now such examples as this of simultaneous mimicry in several species
  are of peculiar interest for us when we come to inquire more closely into
  the process by which the resemblances can be supposed to have been
  brought about. Take for example the case of <i>E. undularis</i>. The male
  is evidently an unprotected insect in so far as mimicry is concerned,
  while the female exhibits the general pattern and coloration
  characteristic of the warningly coloured and presumably distasteful
  species <i>D. plexippus</i> or <i>D. chrysippus</i>. If we are to suppose
  this to have been brought about by the operation of natural selection it
  is clear that we must regard the colour and pattern of the male as the
  original colour and pattern of both sexes. For natural selection cannot
  be supposed to have operated in causing the male to pass from a protected
  to an unprotected condition, or even in causing him <!-- Page 68 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page68"></a>{68}</span>to change one unprotected
  condition for another. Probably all adherents of the mimicry theory would
  be agreed in regarding the male of <i>Elymnias undularis</i> as shewing
  the ancestral coloration of the species, and in looking upon the female
  as having been modified to her own advantage in the direction of <i>D.
  plexippus</i>. The question that we have to try to decide is how this has
  come about&mdash;whether by the accumulation of slight variations, or
  whether by a sudden change or mutation in the pattern and colour of the
  female by which she came to resemble closely the Danaine. It is clear
  that if <i>D. plexippus</i> were what it is to-day before the mimetic
  approach on the part of <i>E. undularis</i> began, small variations in
  the latter would have been of no service to it. The difference between
  the two species would have been far too great for individuals exhibiting
  slight variation in the direction of <i>D. plexippus</i> to stand any
  chance of being confused with this species. And unless such confusion
  were possible natural selection could not work. There is, however, an
  immediate way out of the difficulty. We may suppose that the coloration
  of the male of the mimic, <i>E. undularis</i>, is not only the ancestral
  colour of its own species but also of the model. <i>D. plexippus</i> on
  this supposition was very like <i>E. undularis</i>, of which both sexes
  were then similar to what the male is to-day. The pattern is, however, an
  inconspicuous one, and it can be imagined that it might be to the
  advantage of <i>D. plexippus</i> to don a brighter garb for the
  advertisement of its unpleasant qualities. <!-- Page 69 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page69"></a>{69}</span>Variations in the
  direction of a more conspicuous pattern would for that reason tend to be
  preserved by natural selection, until eventually was evolved through its
  means the well-marked pattern so characteristic of the model to-day. If
  in the meantime variations in the same direction occurred among the
  females of <i>E. undularis</i> these would tend to be preserved through
  their resemblance to the developing warning pattern of the distasteful
  Danaine model. The development of model and mimic would proceed <i>pari
  passu</i>, but if the sexes of the mimic differ, as in this case, we must
  suppose the starting-point to have been the condition exhibited by the
  male of the mimicking species.</p>

  <p>But <i>Argynnis hyperbius</i> is also a species in which the female
  mimics <i>D. plexippus</i>; and by using the same argument as that just
  detailed for <i>Elymnias undularis</i> we can shew that the Danaine
  model, <i>D. plexippus</i>, must also have been like the male of
  <i>Argynnis hyperbius</i>. And if the resemblance of <i>A. hyperbius</i>
  was developed subsequently to that of <i>E. undularis</i>, then both
  <i>D. plexippus</i> and <i>E. undularis</i> must at one time have been
  like the male of <i>A. hyperbius</i>, a proposition to which few
  entomologists are likely to assent. Further, since the female of <i>H.
  misippus</i> also comes into the <i>plexippus-chrysippus</i> combine we
  must suppose that these species must at some time or another have passed
  through a pattern stage like that of the <i>misippus</i> male.</p>

  <p>It is scarcely necessary to pursue this argument <!-- Page 70 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page70"></a>{70}</span>further, for even the
  most devoted adherents of the theory of mimicry as brought about by the
  operation of natural selection on small variations are hardly likely to
  subscribe to the phylogenetic consequences which it must entail in cases
  where a model is mimicked by the females of several species whose males
  are widely dissimilar in appearance.</p>

  <p>Even if we suppose the two Danaines to have been originally like the
  male of one of the three mimics, we must still suppose that the females
  of the other two originated as "sports," sufficiently near to Danaines to
  be confused with them. But if such sports can be produced suddenly by
  some mutational process not at present understood, why should not these
  sports be the females of the three mimicking species as we see them at
  present? Why need we suppose that there were intermediate stages between
  the mimicking female and the original hypothetical female which was like
  the male? If a sport occurred which was sufficiently similar to an
  unpalatable species to be confused with it, it is theoretically
  demonstrable that, although relatively scarce to start with, it would
  rapidly increase at the expense of the unprotected male-like female until
  the latter was eliminated. We shall, however, return in a later chapter
  (p. <a href="#page96">96</a>) to the argument by which this view can be
  supported.</p>

  <p>So far we have discussed what we called the two extreme views as to
  the way in which a mimetic resemblance may be supposed to have
  originated. Of the two that which assumes the resemblance to have <!--
  Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page71"></a>{71}</span>been
  brought about by a succession of slight variations must also assume that
  model and mimic were closely alike to start with, and this certainly
  cannot be true in many cases. On the other hand, there is so far no
  reason against the idea of supposing the resemblance to have originated
  suddenly except what to most minds will probably appear its inherent
  improbability.</p>

  <p>There are writers on these questions of mimicry who adopt a view more
  or less intermediate between those just discussed. They regard the
  resemblance as having arisen in the first place as a sport of some
  magnitude on the part of the mimic, rendering it sufficiently like the
  model to cause some confusion between the two. A rough-hewn resemblance
  is first brought about by a process of mutation. Natural selection is in
  this way given something to work on, and forthwith proceeds to polish up
  the resemblance until it becomes exceedingly close. Natural selection
  does not originate the likeness, but, as soon as a rough one has made its
  appearance, it comes into operation and works it up through intermediate
  stages into the finished portrait. It still plays some part in the
  formation of a mimetic resemblance though its rôle is now restricted to
  the putting on of the finishing touches. Those who take this view hold
  also that the continued action of natural selection is necessary in order
  to keep the likeness up to the mark. They suppose that if selection
  ceases the likeness gradually deteriorates owing to the coming into
  operation of a mysterious <!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page72"></a>{72}</span>process called regression. This idea
  involves certain conceptions as to the nature of variation which we shall
  discuss later.</p>

  <p>Though it is difficult to regard Batesian mimicry as produced by the
  accumulation of small variations through natural selection, it is perhaps
  rather more plausible to suppose that such a process may happen in
  connection with the numerous instances of Müllerian mimicry. For since
  the end result is theoretically to the advantage of both species instead
  of but one, it is possible to argue that the process would be simplified
  by their meeting one another halfway, as Müller<a name="footnotetag34"
  href="#footnote34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> himself originally suggested.
  Variations on the part of each in the direction of the other would be
  favourably selected, the mimicry being reciprocal.</p>

  <p>Difficulties, however, begin to arise when we inquire into the way in
  which this unification of pattern may be conceived of as having come
  about. By no one have these difficulties been more forcibly presented
  than by Marshall<a name="footnotetag35"
  href="#footnote35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> in an able paper published a few
  years ago, and perhaps the best way of appreciating them is to take a
  hypothetical case used by him as an illustration.</p>

  <p>Let us suppose that in the same area live two equally distasteful
  species <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, each with a conspicuous though distinct
  warning pattern, and each sacrificing 1000 individuals yearly to the
  education of young <!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page73"></a>{73}</span>birds. Further let it be supposed that
  <i>A</i> is a common species of which there are 100,000 individuals in
  the given area, while <i>B</i> is much rarer, and is represented by 5000.
  The toll exacted by young birds falls relatively more lightly upon
  <i>A</i> than upon <i>B</i>, for <i>A</i> loses only 1%, whereas
  <i>B</i>'s loss is 20%. Clearly if some members of <i>B</i> varied so
  that they could be mistaken for <i>A</i> it would be greatly to their
  advantage, since they would pass from a population in which the
  destruction by young birds was 20% to one in which it would now be rather
  less than 1%. Moreover, as the proportion of <i>B</i> resembling <i>A</i>
  gradually increased owing to this advantage, the losses suffered by those
  exhibiting the original <i>B</i> pattern would be relatively heavier and
  heavier until the form was ultimately eliminated. In other words, it is
  theoretically conceivable that of two distasteful species with different
  patterns the rarer could be brought to resemble the more abundant.</p>

  <p>We may consider now what would happen in the converse case in which
  the more numerous species exhibited a variation owing to which it was
  confused with the rarer. Suppose that of the 100,000 individuals of
  <i>A</i> 10,000 shewed a variation which led to their being mistaken for
  <i>B</i>, so that there are 90,000 of the <i>A</i> pattern and 15,000 of
  the <i>B</i> pattern of which 10,000 belong to species <i>A</i>. <i>A</i>
  will now lose 1000 out of the 90,000 having the <i>A</i> pattern, and
  &#x2154; × 1000 out of the 10,000 of species <i>A</i> which exhibit the
  <i>B</i> pattern. The toll of the birds will be <span
  class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">90</span> of those keeping
  the original <i>A</i> pattern, and <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span
  class="suu">30</span> of those of species <i>A</i> which have <!-- Page
  74 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page74"></a>{74}</span>assumed the
  <i>B</i> pattern. The mortality among the mimetic members of <i>A</i> is
  six times as great as among those which retain the type form. It is clear
  therefore that a variation of <i>A</i> which can be mistaken for <i>B</i>
  is at a great disadvantage as compared with the type form<a
  name="footnotetag36" href="#footnote36"><sup>[36]</sup></a>, and
  consequently it must be supposed that the Müllerian factor, as the
  destruction due to experimental tasting by young birds is termed, cannot
  bring about a resemblance on the part of a more numerous to a less
  numerous species. Further, as Marshall goes on to shew, there can be no
  approach of one species to the other when the numbers are approximately
  equal. A condition essential for the establishing of a mimetic
  resemblance on Müllerian lines, no less than on Batesian, is that the
  less numerous species should take on the pattern of the more numerous.
  Consequently the argument brought forward in the earlier part of this
  chapter against the establishing of such a likeness by a long series of
  slight variations is equally valid for Müllerian mimicry<a
  name="footnotetag37" href="#footnote37"><sup>[37]</sup></a>.</p>

<h5>CHAPTER VII</h5>

<h5 class="scac">THE CASE OF <i>PAPILIO POLYTES</i></h5>

  <p>Many instances of mimicry are known to-day, but comparatively few of
  them have been studied in any detail. Yet a single carefully analysed
  case is worth dozens which are merely superficially recorded. In trying
  to arrive at some conception of the way in which the resemblance has come
  about we want to know the nature and extent of the likeness in the living
  as well as in the dead; the relative abundance of model and mimic; what
  are likely enemies and whether they could be supposed to select in the
  way required, whether the model is distasteful to them; whether
  intermediate forms occur among the mimics; how the various forms behave
  when bred together, etc., etc. Probably the form that from these many
  points of view has, up to the present, been studied with most care is
  that of the Swallow-tail, <i>Papilio polytes</i>. It is a common
  butterfly throughout the greater part of India and Ceylon, and closely
  allied forms, probably to be reckoned in the same species, reach
  eastwards through China as far as Hongkong. <i>P. polytes</i> is one of
  those species which exhibit polymorphism in the female sex. Three
  distinct forms of female are known, of which one is like the male, while
  the other two are very different. Indeed <!-- Page 76 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page76"></a>{76}</span>for many years they were
  regarded as distinct species, and given definite specific names. To
  Wallace belongs the credit of shewing that these three forms of female
  are all to be regarded as wives of the same type of male<a
  name="footnotetag38" href="#footnote38"><sup>[38]</sup></a>. He shewed
  that there were no males corresponding to two of the females; also that
  the same one male form was always to be found wherever any of the females
  occurred. As the result of breeding experiments in more recent years
  Wallace's conclusions have been shewn to be perfectly sound.</p>

  <p>The male of <i>polytes</i> (<a href="#plateV">Pl. V</a>, fig. 1) is a
  handsome blackish insect with a wing expanse of about four inches. With
  the exception of some yellowish-white spots along their outer margin the
  fore wings are entirely dark. Similar spots occur along the margin of the
  hind wing also, while across the middle runs a series of six
  yellowish-white patches producing the appearance of a broad light band.
  The thorax and abdomen are full black, though the black of the head is
  relieved by a few lighter yellowish scales. The under surface is much
  like the upper, the chief difference being a series of small and slightly
  reddish lunules running outside the light band near the margin of the
  hind wing (<a href="#plateV">Pl. V</a>, fig. 1 <i>a</i>). In some
  specimens these markings are almost absent. One form of female is almost
  exactly like the male (<a href="#plateV">Pl. V</a>, fig. 2), the one
  slight difference being that the lunules on the under surface of the hind
  wing are generally a trifle larger. For brevity she may be called the
  <i>M</i> form. The second form of female <!-- Page 77 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page77"></a>{77}</span>differs in many respects
  from the male and the <i>M</i> female. Instead of being quite dark, the
  fore wings are marked by darker ribbed lines on a lighter ground<a
  name="footnotetag39" href="#footnote39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> (<a
  href="#plateV">Pl. V</a>, fig. 3). The hind wings shew several marked
  differences from those of the male. Of the series of six patches forming
  the cross band the outermost has nearly disappeared, and the innermost
  has become smaller and reddish. The middle four, on the other hand, have
  become deeper, reaching up towards the insertion of the wing, and are
  pure white. A series of red lunules occurs on the upper surface outside
  the white band, and the yellowish-white marginal markings tend to become
  red. These differences are equally well marked on the under surface (<a
  href="#plateV">Pl. V</a>, fig. 3 <i>a</i>). The colour of the body,
  however, remains as in the male. From the resemblance shewn by this form
  to another species of Swallow-tail, <i>Papilio aristolochiae</i> (<a
  href="#plateV">Pl. V</a>, fig. 5), we shall speak of it as the <i>A</i>
  form.</p>

  <p>The third form of female is again very distinct from the other two.
  The fore wings are dark but are broken by an irregular white band running
  across the middle (<a href="#plateV">Pl. V</a>, fig. 4), and there is
  also an irregular white patch nearer the tips of the wing. The hind
  wings, on the other hand, are characterised by having only red markings.
  The yellowish-white band of the male is much reduced and is entirely red,
  while the red lunules are much larger than in the <i>A</i> form. The
  under surface (<a href="#plateV">Pl. V</a>, fig. 4 <i>a</i>) corresponds
  closely with the <!-- Page 78 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page78"></a>{78}</span>upper. The body remains black as in all the
  other forms. This type of female bears a resemblance to <i>Papilio
  hector</i> (<a href="#plateV">Pl. V</a>, fig. 6), and for that reason we
  shall speak of it as the <i>H</i> form. It should be added that these
  three forms of female are quite indistinguishable in the larval and
  chrysalis stages.</p>

  <p>It was Wallace who first offered an explanation of this interesting
  case in terms of mimicry. According to this interpretation <i>P.
  polytes</i> is a palatable form. The larva, which feeds on citronaceous
  plants, and the chrysalis are both inconspicuous in their natural
  surroundings. They may be regarded as protectively coloured, and
  consequently edible and liable to persecution. The original coloration is
  that of the male and the <i>M</i> female. From this the other two forms
  of female have diverged in the direction of greater instead of less
  conspicuousness, although the presumed edibility of the insect might have
  led us to think that a less conspicuous coloration would have been more
  to its advantage. But these two females resemble the two species
  <i>Papilio aristolochiae</i> and <i>Papilio hector</i>, which, though
  placed in the same genus as <i>P. polytes</i>, belong to a very different
  section of it<a name="footnotetag40"
  href="#footnote40"><sup>[40]</sup></a>. The larvae of these two species
  are conspicuously coloured black and red with spiny tubercles. They feed
  upon the poisonous <i>Aristolochia</i> plants. For these reasons and also
  from the fact that the butterflies themselves are both conspicuous and
  plentiful it is inferred that they are unpalatable. In short, they are
  the models upon <!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page79"></a>{79}</span>which the two <i>polytes</i> females that
  are unlike the male have been built up by natural selection.</p>

  <p>The suggestion of mimicry in this case is supported by the fact that
  there is a general correspondence between the areas of distribution of
  model and mimic. <i>P. hector</i> is not found outside India and Ceylon,
  and the <i>H</i> female of <i>P. polytes</i> is also confined to this
  area. <i>P. aristolochiae</i>, on the other hand, has a much wider range,
  almost as wide indeed as that of <i>P. polytes</i> itself. Generally
  speaking the <i>A</i> female accompanies <i>P. aristolochiae</i> wherever
  the latter species is found. Beyond the range of <i>P. aristolochiae</i>,
  in northern China, the <i>M</i> female alone is said to occur. On the
  other hand, as the matter comes to be more closely studied exceptions are
  beginning to turn up. The <i>H</i> female, for instance, is found on the
  lower slopes of the Himalayas, far north of the range of <i>P.
  hector</i>, and there are indications that a careful study of the
  distribution in China and Japan may prove of importance.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the investigation of a smaller area may also bring to light
  points of difficulty. In Ceylon, for example, <i>P. polytes</i> is common
  up to several thousand feet, while <i>P. hector</i> is rare at half the
  height to which <i>polytes</i> ascends. Nevertheless the <i>H</i> form of
  female is relatively just as abundant up-country where <i>hector</i> is
  rarely found as it is low down where <i>hector</i> is plentiful<a
  name="footnotetag41" href="#footnote41"><sup>[41]</sup></a>. On the other
  hand, <i>P. aristolochiae</i> may be exceedingly abundant at altitudes
  where <i>hector</i> is scarce. Yet the <i>A</i> form of <i>polytes</i> is
  no more relatively abundant <!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page80"></a>{80}</span>here than elsewhere on the island. All over
  Ceylon, in fact, the relative proportions of the three forms of female
  appear to be the same, quite irrespective of the abundance or scarcity of
  either of the models. As, however, we shall have to return to this point
  later, we may leave it for the moment to consider other features of this
  case of <i>P. polytes</i>.</p>

  <p>In collections of insects from India or Ceylon it is not unusual to
  find specimens of the <i>A</i> form of female of <i>polytes</i> placed
  with <i>P. aristolochiae</i>, and the <i>H</i> form with <i>P.
  hector</i>. When the insects are old and faded and pinned out on cork the
  mistake is a very natural one. But after all the enemies of
  <i>polytes</i> do not hunt it in corked cabinets, and any estimation of
  resemblance to be of use to us must be based upon the living insects. Are
  the resemblances of the mimics to the models when alive so close that
  they might be expected to deceive such enemies<a name="footnotetag42"
  href="#footnote42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> as prey upon them and have no
  difficulty in distinguishing the male form of <i>polytes</i> from <i>P.
  aristolochiae</i> or <i>P. hector</i>?</p>

  <p>To answer for a bird is a hazardous undertaking. We know so little of
  the bird's perceptive faculties whether of taste or sight. But on general
  grounds, from the specialization of their visual apparatus, it is
  probable that the sense of sight is keen, though whether the colour sense
  is the same as our own is doubtful<a name="footnotetag43"
  href="#footnote43"><sup>[43]</sup></a>. On the other hand, the olfactory
  apparatus <!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page81"></a>{81}</span>is relatively poorly developed in birds, and
  from this we can only argue that the senses of smell and taste are not
  especially acute. Really we can do little more than to describe how these
  mimetic resemblances appear to our own senses, and to infer that they do
  not appear very different to the bird. If there is any difference in
  keenness of perception we shall probably not be far wrong in presuming
  that the advantage rests with the bird. After all if there is any truth
  in the theory of mimicry the bird has to depend largely upon its keenness
  of sight in making its living, at any rate if that living is to be a
  palatable one. If natural selection can bring about these close
  resemblances among butterflies it must certainly be supposed to be
  capable of bringing the bird's powers of vision to a high pitch of
  excellence.</p>

  <p>Returning now to the case of <i>P. polytes</i>, there is not the least
  doubt that to the ordinary man accustomed to use his eyes the <i>A</i>
  form of female is easily distinguishable from <i>P. aristolochiae</i>, as
  also is the <i>H</i> form from <i>P. hector</i>. The two models have a
  feature in common in which they both differ from their respective mimics.
  In both of them the body and head are largely of a brilliant scarlet,
  whereas neither of the mimics has a touch of red on the body. In the
  living insect when the body is swelled by its natural juices the effect
  is very striking<a name="footnotetag44"
  href="#footnote44"><sup>[44]</sup></a>. It gives at once a "dangerous"
  look <!-- Page 82 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page82"></a>{82}</span>to the insect when settled, even at a
  distance of several yards, and this although one may be perfectly
  familiar with its harmless nature. The mimics on the other hand with
  their sombre-coloured bodies never look otherwise than the inoffensive
  creatures that they are. The "dangerous" look due to the brilliant
  scarlet of the body and head of <i>hector</i> and <i>aristolochiae</i> is
  reinforced by the quality of the red on the markings of the wings. In
  both models it is a strong clamorous red suggestive of a powerful aniline
  dye, whereas such red as occurs in the mimics is a softer and totally
  distinct colour. The difference in quality is even more marked on the
  under than on the upper surface (<a href="#plateV">Pl. V</a>, figs. 3
  <i>a</i>&mdash;6 <i>a</i>), and the net result is that when settled, with
  wings either expanded or closed, there is no possibility of an ordinarily
  observant man mistaking mimic for model in either case, even at a
  distance of several yards.</p>

  <p>It may, however, be argued that it is not when at rest but during
  flight that the mimetic resemblance protects the mimic from attack.
  Actually this can hardly be true, for the mode of flight constitutes one
  of the most striking differences between model and mimic. <i>P.
  hector</i> and <i>P. aristolochiae</i> fly much in the same way. They
  give one the impression of flying mainly with their fore wings, which
  vibrate rapidly, so that the course of the insect, though not swift, is
  on the whole sustained and even. The flight of all the different forms of
  <i>polytes</i> is similar and quite distinct from that of the models. It
  is a strong but rather <!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page83"></a>{83}</span>heavy and lumbering up-and-down flight. One
  gets the impression that all the wing surface is being used instead of
  principally the fore wings as appears in <i>P. hector</i> and <i>P.
  aristolochiae</i>. The difference is difficult to put into words, but
  owing to these peculiarities of flight the eye has no difficulty in
  distinguishing between model and mimic even at a distance of 40 to 50
  yards. Moreover, colour need not enter into the matter at all. It is even
  easier to distinguish model from mimic when flying against a bright
  background, as for instance when the insect is between the observer and a
  sunlit sky, than it is to do so by reflected light. I have myself spent
  many days in doing little else but chasing <i>polytes</i> at Trincomalee
  where it was flying in company with <i>P. hector</i>, but I was never
  once lured into chasing the model in mistake for the mimic. My experience
  was that whether at rest or flying the species are perfectly distinct,
  and I find it difficult to imagine that a bird whose living depended in
  part upon its ability to discriminate between the different forms would
  be likely to be misled. Certainly it would not be if its powers of
  discrimination were equal to those of an ordinary civilised man. If the
  bird were unable to distinguish between say the <i>A</i> form of female
  and <i>P. aristolochiae</i> I think that it would be still less likely to
  distinguish between the same <i>A</i> form and the male or the <i>M</i>
  form of female. For my experience was that at a little distance one could
  easily confuse the <i>A</i> form of <i>polytes</i> with the male. Except
  when one was quite close the red on the <i>A</i> form was apt to be lost,
  the <!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page84"></a>{84}</span>white markings on the hind wing were readily
  confused with those of the male, and one had to depend entirely on the
  lighter fore wing. Unless the bird were keener sighted than the man the
  <i>A</i> form would be more likely to be taken in mistake for its
  unprotected relative than avoided for its resemblance to the presumably
  unpalatable model. On the other hand, if the bird were sufficiently keen
  sighted never to confuse the <i>A</i> female with the male form its sight
  would be too keen to be imposed upon by such resemblance as exists
  between the <i>A</i> female and <i>P. aristolochiae</i>.</p>

  <p>These, however, are not the only criticisms of the theory of mimicry
  which the study of this species forces upon us. <i>Papilio polytes</i> is
  one of the few mimetic species that has been bred, and in no other case
  of polymorphism is the relation between the different forms so clearly
  understood. For this result we are indebted mainly to the careful
  experiments of Mr J. C. F. Fryer, who recently devoted the best part of
  two years to breeding the different forms of this butterfly in Ceylon<a
  name="footnotetag45" href="#footnote45"><sup>[45]</sup></a>. Fryer came
  to the conclusion that an explanation of this curious case is possible on
  ordinary Mendelian lines. At first sight the breeding results appear
  complicated, for any one of the three forms of female can behave in
  several different ways. For the sake of simplicity we may for the moment
  class together the <i>A</i> and <i>H</i> females as the mimetic females,
  the non-mimetic being represented by the <i>M</i> or male-like females.
  <!-- Page 85 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"></a>{85}</span>The
  different kinds of families which each of the three females can produce
  may be tabulated as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>(<span class="grk">&alpha;</span>) The <i>M</i> form may give either:&mdash;</p>
      <p class="i2">(1)  <i>M</i> only.</p>
      <p class="i2">(2)  <i>M</i> and mimetics in about equal numbers.</p>
      <p class="i2">(3)  Mimetics only.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>(<span class="grk">&beta;</span>) The <i>A</i> form may give either:&mdash;</p>
      <p class="i2">(1)  <i>M</i> and mimetics in about equal numbers.</p>
      <p class="i2">(2)  <i>M</i> and mimetics in the ratio of about 1:3.</p>
      <p class="i2">(3)  Mimetics only.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>(<span class="grk">&gamma;</span>) The <i>H</i> form may give either:&mdash;</p>
      <p class="i2">(1)  <i>M</i> and mimetics in about equal numbers.</p>
      <p class="i2">(2)  <i>M</i> and mimetics in the ratio of about 1:3.</p>
      <p class="i2">(3)  Mimetics only.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The males are in all cases alike to look at but it must nevertheless
  be supposed that they differ in their transmitting powers. In fact the
  evidence all points to there being three different kinds of male
  corresponding to the three different kinds of female. But they cannot
  shew any difference outwardly because there is always present in the male
  a factor which inhibits the production of the mimetic pattern even though
  the factor for that pattern be present.</p>

  <p>Returning now to the records of the females it will be noticed that
  although the <i>M</i> form may breed true the mimetics never give the
  <i>M</i> form alone. Where they give the <i>M</i> form among their
  progeny they produce mimetics and non-mimetics either in the ratio 1:1 or
  of 3:1. This at once suggests that the <!-- Page 86 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page86"></a>{86}</span>non-mimetic is recessive
  to the mimetic forms&mdash;that the mimetics contain a factor which does
  not occur in the non-mimetics. If this factor, which may be called
  <i>X</i>, be added to the constitution of a non-mimetic female it turns
  it into a mimetic. If <i>X</i> be added to a male such an individual,
  though incapable of itself exhibiting the mimetic pattern owing to the
  inhibitory factor always present in that sex, becomes capable of
  transmitting the mimetic factor to its offspring. Expressed in the usual
  Mendelian way the formulae for these different butterflies are as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td><i>M</i>&#x2640; </td><td class="ac"> = </td><td class="br pr1"> <span class="hid">or</span> <i>iixx</i> </td><td class="pl2"> <i>Iixx</i> </td><td> = &#x2642; (1)</td></tr>

</table>

  <p>where <i>X</i> stands for the mimetic factor and <i>I</i> for the
  factor which inhibits the action of <i>X</i>. All males are heterozygous
  for <i>I</i>, but during the segregation of characters at some stage in
  the formation of the families only the male-producing sperms come to
  contain the factor <i>I</i>. It is lacking in all the female-producing
  sperms formed by the male.</p>

  <p>&#x2642; (1) does not contain the factor for the mimetic condition and
  gives only daughters of the <i>M</i> form when mated with an
  <i>M</i>&#x2640;. &#x2642; (2) on the other hand is homozygous for the
  factor <i>X</i>, and consequently all of his germ cells contain it. This
  is the male that gives nothing but mimetic daughters with whatever form
  of female he is bred. &#x2642; (3) is heterozygous for <i>X</i>; that is
  to say, one half of his germ cells contain it, the other half not. With
  the <i>M</i>&#x2640; he must give equal numbers <!-- Page 87 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page87"></a>{87}</span>of offspring with and
  without <i>X</i>, <i>i.e.</i> half of his daughters will be mimetic and
  the other half non-mimetic. With a heterozygous mimetic female
  (<i>iiXx</i>), which is also producing germ cells with and without
  <i>X</i> in equal numbers, he may be expected to give the usual result,
  viz. dominants and recessives in the ratio 3:1; or in other words mimetic
  and non-mimetic females in the ratio 3:1.</p>

  <p>One of Fryer's experiments may be given here in illustration of the
  nature of the evidence upon which the above hypothesis depends.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Families were reared from the two wild <i>H</i> females of whom
  nothing was known either as to ancestry or husband. The first family
  contained 10 <i>M</i> and 7 <i>H</i> females. Hence the original wild
  mother was probably <i>iiXx</i> and had mated with a male of the
  constitution <!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page88"></a>{88}</span><i>Iixx</i>. The family from the second wild
  <i>H</i> female contained 26 <i>H</i> and 7 <i>M</i> females; <i>i.e.</i>
  the ratio in which these two forms appeared was not far from 3:1. Hence
  the wild female was probably <i>iiXx</i> and her husband <i>IiXx</i>. If
  this were so some of the 26 &#x2642;&#x2642; should receive the <i>X</i>
  factor from both parents and consequently be <i>IiXX</i> in constitution.
  This was almost certainly so in the case of the single male in this brood
  tested by mating with an <i>M</i> female from the other brood. All of his
  12 daughters were of the <i>H</i> form, as should have been the case had
  his constitution been <i>IiXX</i>. Supposing this to be so, all his
  offspring, of both sexes, must be heterozygous for <i>X</i>. Consequently
  any pair mated together should give both <i>H</i> and <i>M</i> females in
  the ratio of three of the former to one of the latter. In Mr Fryer's
  experiment two males and two females chosen at random were mated
  together. In the one case six <i>H</i> and one <i>M</i> female were
  produced, in the other ten <i>H</i> and two <i>M</i> females. As was
  expected both classes of female appeared, and the looked-for ratio of
  three <i>H</i> to one <i>M</i> was, in view of the smallness of the
  numbers, not departed from widely in either instance.</p>

  <p>In the experiments selected as an illustration, the mimetic females
  happen to be all of the <i>H</i> form. In other experiments, however,
  both the <i>H</i> form and the <i>A</i> form occurred. As the result of
  his experiments Mr Fryer came to the conclusion that here again the
  difference is one of a single hereditary factor. All mimetic females
  contain the <i>X</i> factor, but the <i>H</i> <!-- Page 89 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page89"></a>{89}</span>females contain in
  addition a factor which we may call <i>Y</i>. The function of the
  <i>Y</i> factor is to carry the change made by the <i>X</i> factor a step
  further, and to turn the <i>A</i> form of female into the <i>H</i> form.
  <i>Y</i> is a modifier of <i>X</i>, but unless <i>X</i> is present
  <i>Y</i> can produce no effect. All the different individuals which are
  to be found among <i>P. polytes</i> in Ceylon may be represented as

  <p>In this way is offered a simple explanation in terms of three
  Mendelian factors which serves at once to explain the various results of
  the breeding experiments, and the fact that intermediates between the
  different forms of female are not found.</p>

  <p>The only other experiments comparable with these on <i>P. polytes</i>
  are some made by Jacobsen on <i>Papilio memnon</i> in Java<a
  name="footnotetag46" href="#footnote46"><sup>[46]</sup></a>. Here again
  there are three forms of female, one of which, <i>laomedon</i>, is
  something like the male, while the other two, <i>agenor</i> and
  <i>achates</i>, are quite distinct. Of these three <i>achates</i>, unlike
  the male and the other two females, is tailed, and resembles <!-- Page 90
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page90"></a>{90}</span>the species
  <i>Papilio coon</i> which belongs to the same presumably distasteful
  group as <i>P. aristolochiae</i>. These experiments of Jacobsen's are not
  so complete as the series on <i>P. polytes</i>, but Professor de Meijere
  and Mr Fryer have both pointed out that they are capable of being
  interpreted on the same simple lines.</p>

  <p>Another instance of experimental breeding involving polymorphism and
  mimicry in the female sex is that of the African <i>Papilio dardanus</i>,
  but the case is here complicated by the greater number of female forms
  (cf. pp. <a href="#page30">30</a>-<a href="#page33">33</a>). The data,
  too, are far more scanty than in the other two cases, but so far as they
  go there is nothing to preclude an explanation being eventually arrived
  at on similar lines<a name="footnotetag47"
  href="#footnote47"><sup>[47]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>And now we may consider briefly the bearing of these experiments on
  the theory of mimicry. Throughout the work no individuals intermediate
  between the three well-marked forms of <i>polytes</i> were met with.
  There is no difference in appearance between the heterozygous and the
  homozygous mimetic insects, whether they belong to the <i>A</i> or to the
  <i>H</i> form. The factor <i>X</i>, whether inherited from both parents,
  or from one only, produces its full effect, and the same is also true of
  the action of the factor <i>Y</i>. Now the most generally accepted
  hypothesis as to the formation of these mimetic resemblances supposes
  that they have been brought about through the gradual operation of
  natural selection accumulating slight variations. <!-- Page 91 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page91"></a>{91}</span>Professor Poulton, for
  example, a prominent exponent of this school, considers that the <i>A</i>
  form of female was first evolved gradually from the <i>M</i> form, and
  later on the <i>H</i> form came by degrees from the <i>A</i> form. If
  this be true we ought, by mingling the <i>M</i> germ plasm with the
  <i>H</i> germ plasm and by subsequently breeding from the insects
  produced, to get back our series of hypothetical intermediates, or at any
  rate some of them. We ought as it were to reverse the process by which
  the evolution of the different forms has taken place. But as is shewn by
  the experiment of Mr Fryer, which was quoted above, nothing of the sort
  happens.</p>

  <p>From experiments with cultivated plants such as primulas and sweet
  peas, we have learnt that this discontinuous form of inheritance which
  occurs in <i>P. polytes</i> is the regular thing. Moreover, we have
  plenty of historical evidence that the new character which behaves in
  this way is one that has arisen suddenly without the formation of
  intermediate steps. The dwarf "Cupid" form of sweet pea, for instance,
  behaves in heredity towards the normal form as though the difference
  between them were a difference of a single factor. It is quite certain
  that the "Cupid" arose as a sudden sport from the normal without the
  intervention of anything in the way of intermediates. And there is every
  reason to suppose that the same is true for plenty of other characters
  involving colour and pattern as well as structure, both in the sweet pea,
  the primula, and other species. Since the forms of <i>polytes</i> female
  behave in breeding like the various <!-- Page 92 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page92"></a>{92}</span>forms of sweet pea and
  primula there is every reason to suppose that they <i>arose</i> in the
  same way, that is to say, as sudden sports or mutations and not by the
  gradual accumulation of slight differences.</p>

  <p>But if we take this view, which is certainly most consonant with the
  evidence before us, we must assign to natural selection a different rôle
  from that which is generally ascribed to it. We cannot suppose that
  natural selection has played any part in the <i>formation</i> of a
  mimetic likeness. The likeness turned up suddenly as a sport quite
  independently of natural selection. But although natural selection may
  have had nothing to do with its production, it may nevertheless have come
  into play in connection with the <i>conservation</i> of the new form. If
  the new form possesses some advantage over the pre-existing one from
  which it sprang, is it not conceivable that natural selection will come
  into operation to render it the predominant form? To this question we
  shall try to find an answer in the next chapter.</p>

<h5>CHAPTER VIII</h5>

<h5 class="scac">THE CASE OF <i>PAPILIO POLYTES</i> (<i>cont.</i>)</h5>

  <p>It was suggested in the last chapter that if a new variation arose as
  a sport&mdash;as a sudden hereditary variation&mdash;and if that
  variation were, through resemblance to a different and unpalatable
  species, to be more immune to the attacks of enemies than the normal
  form, it was conceivable that the newer mimetic sport would become
  established, and in time perhaps come to be the only form of the species.
  We may suppose, for example, that the <i>A</i> female of <i>P.
  polytes</i> arose suddenly, and that owing to its likeness to the
  presumably distasteful <i>P. aristolochiae</i> it became rapidly more
  numerous until in some localities it is the commonest or even the only
  form. However, before discussing the establishing of a mimetic form in
  this manner we must first deal with certain general results which may be
  expected to follow on a process of selection applied to members of a
  population presenting variations which are inherited on ordinary
  Mendelian lines.</p>

  <p>Let us suppose that we are dealing with the inheritance of a character
  which depends upon the presence of the genetic factor <i>X</i>; and let
  us also suppose that the heterozygous form () is indistinguishable <!--
  Page 94 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page94"></a>{94}</span>from the
  homozygous form () in appearance. In other words the character dependent
  upon <i>X</i> exhibits complete dominance. With regard to <i>X</i> then
  all the members of our population must belong to one or other of three
  classes. They may be homozygous (<i>XX</i>) for <i>X</i>, having received
  it from both parents, or they may be heterozygous (<i>Xx</i>) because
  they have received it from only one parent, or they may be devoid of
  <i>X</i>, <i>i.e.</i> pure recessives (<i>xx</i>). An interesting
  question arises as to the conditions under which a population containing
  these three kinds of individuals remains stable. By stability is meant
  that with the three kinds mating freely among themselves and being all
  equally fertile, there is no tendency for the relative proportions of the
  three classes to be disturbed from generation to generation. The question
  was looked into some years ago by G. H. Hardy, who shewed that if the
  mixed population consist of <i>p XX</i> individuals, <i>2q Xx</i>
  individuals and <i>r xx</i> individuals, the population will be in stable
  equilibrium with regard to the relative proportions of these three
  classes so long as the equation <i>pr = q<sup>2</sup></i> is satisfied<a
  name="footnotetag48" href="#footnote48"><sup>[48]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Now let us suppose that in place of equality of conditions selection
  is exercised in favour of those individuals which exhibit the dominant
  character. It has been shewn by Mr Norton that even if the selection
  exercised were slight the result in the end would be that the recessive
  form would entirely disappear. The total time required for bringing this
  about would <!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page95"></a>{95}</span>depend upon two things, (1) the proportion
  of dominants existing in the population before the process of selection
  began, and (2) the intensity of the selection process itself. Suppose,
  for example, that we started with a population consisting of pure
  dominants, heterozygotes, and recessives in the ratio 1:4:4. Since these
  figures satisfy the equation <i>pr = q<sup>2</sup></i>, such a population
  mating at random within itself is in a state of stable equilibrium. Now
  let us suppose that the dominant form (including of course the
  heterozygotes) is endowed with a selection advantage over the recessives
  of 10%, or in other words that the relative proportion of the recessives
  who survive to breed is only 90% of the proportion of dominants that
  survive<a name="footnotetag49" href="#footnote49"><sup>[49]</sup></a>. It
  is clear that the proportion of dominants must gradually increase and
  that of the recessives diminish.</p>

  <p>At what rate will this change in the population take place? Mr Norton
  has worked this out (see App. I) and has shewn that at the end of 12
  generations the proportions of pure dominants, heterozygotes, and
  recessives will be 1:2:1. The population will have reached another
  position of equilibrium, but the proportion of recessives from being
  four-ninths of the <!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page96"></a>{96}</span>total is now reduced to one-quarter. After
  18 more generations the proportions 4:4:1 are reached, the recessives
  being only one-ninth of the total; after 40 further generations of the
  process they become reduced to one-fortieth. In other words a selective
  advantage of 10% operating against the recessives will reduce their
  numbers in 70 generations from nearly one-half of the population to less
  than one-fortieth.</p>

  <p>With a less stringent selective rate the number of generations
  elapsing before this result is brought about will be larger. If, for
  example, the selective rate is diminished from 10% to 1% the number of
  generations necessary for bringing about the same change is nearly 700
  instead of 70&mdash;roughly ten times as great. Even so, and one can
  hardly speak of a 1% selective rate as a stringent one, it is remarkable
  in how brief a space of time a form which is discriminated against, even
  lightly, is bound to disappear. Evolution, in so far as it consists of
  the supplanting of one form by another, may be a very much more rapid
  process than has hitherto been suspected, for natural selection, if
  appreciable, must be held to operate with extraordinary swiftness where
  it is given established variations with which to work.</p>

  <p>We may now consider the bearing of these theoretical deductions upon
  the case of <i>Papilio polytes</i> in Ceylon. Here is a case of a
  population living and breeding together under the same conditions, a
  population in which there are three classes depending upon the presence
  or absence of two factors, <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>, <!-- Page 97 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page97"></a>{97}</span>exhibiting ordinary
  Mendelian inheritance. For the present we may consider one of these
  factors, <i>X</i>, which involves the proportion of mimetic to
  non-mimetic forms. It is generally agreed among observers who have
  studied this species that of the three forms of female the <i>M</i> form
  is distinctly the most common, while of the other two the <i>H</i> form
  is rather more numerous than the <i>A</i> form. The two dominant mimetic
  forms taken together, however, are rather more numerous than the
  recessive <i>M</i> form. The most recent observer who studied this
  question, Mr Fryer, captured 155 specimens in the wild state as larvae.
  When reared 66 turned out to be males, while of the females there were 49
  of the two mimetic forms and 40 of the <i>M</i> form, the ratio of
  dominants to recessives being closely 5:4<a name="footnotetag50"
  href="#footnote50"><sup>[50]</sup></a>. Now as has already been pointed
  out the ratio 5:4 of dominants and recessives is characteristic of a
  population exhibiting simple Mendelian inheritance when in a state of
  stable equilibrium. The natural deduction from Mr Fryer's figures is that
  with regard to the factor that differentiates the mimetic forms from the
  non-mimetic, the <i>polytes</i> population is, for the moment at any
  rate, in a position of stable equilibrium. This may mean one of two
  things. Either the population is definitely in a state of equilibrium
  which has lasted for a period of time in the past <!-- Page 98 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page98"></a>{98}</span>and may be expected to
  endure for a further period in the future, or else the population is in a
  condition of gradual change as regards the numerical proportion of
  mimetics and non-mimetics, progressing towards the elimination of the one
  or the other, the present state of equilibrium being merely transitory
  and accidental. In this connection a few scraps of historical evidence
  are of interest. Of the various forms of <i>P. polytes</i> the <i>A</i>
  form of female was the first to be described in 1758, and not long after
  (1776) the <i>H</i> form was registered as a species under the name of
  <i>Papilio Eques Trojanus romulus</i>. Later on the female resembling the
  male found its way into the literature as <i>Papilio pammon</i>. From the
  fact that the mimetic forms were known before the non-mimetic, it is
  unlikely that they can have been scarce a century and a half ago. As
  <i>P. polytes</i> certainly produces at least four broods a year in
  Ceylon this period of time represents something like 600 generations in
  the life of the species, and we have already seen that even if the
  mimetic forms have but a 1% advantage over the non-mimetic the proportion
  of the latter would decrease from nearly equality down to but 1 in 40 in
  about 700 generations. Actually for <i>P. polytes</i> the decrease would
  not be so marked because the male is non-mimetic. Owing to this peculiar
  feature the rapidity of change in the proportion of the different forms
  is reduced to about one-half of what it would be if the males were also
  mimetic. Nevertheless the change from nearly equality to about one
  non-mimetic in 40 would have taken place <!-- Page 99 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page99"></a>{99}</span>during the time <i>P.
  polytes</i> has been known if a 2% selection advantage had operated
  during that period in favour of the mimetic. If there has been any
  appreciable selection going on during that time mimetics must have been
  far rarer when the species was first discovered, but the fact that both
  the mimetic forms made their way into collections before the non-mimetic
  tells distinctly against this supposition. Nor is there any reason to
  suppose that the non-mimetic form has been dwindling in numbers
  relatively to the mimetics during the last half century. Moore<a
  name="footnotetag51" href="#footnote51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> in 1880
  records an earlier observation of Wade's that "These three butterflies
  are very common, especially those of the first form; the second being
  perhaps least so." The first form alluded to is the <i>M</i> form, and
  the second is the <i>A</i> form, so that at the time Wade wrote the
  relative proportions of these three forms must have been very much what
  they are to-day. Even during half a century and with such a relatively
  weak selection rate as 2% in favour of the mimetics, the proportion of
  non-mimetics should drop from about 4:5 down to about 1:5. Therefore we
  must either infer that in respect of mimetic resemblances natural
  selection does not exist for <i>P. polytes</i> in Ceylon, or else we must
  suppose its force to be so slight that in half a century certainly, and
  perhaps in a century and a half, it can produce no effect appreciable to
  the necessarily rough method of estimation employed. <!-- Page 100
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"></a>{100}</span></p>

  <p>It may, however, be argued that even an exceedingly low selection rate
  is able to bring about the elimination of one or other type provided that
  it acts for a sufficiently long time. This is perfectly true. A selective
  rate of .001% would reduce the proportion of recessives to dominants from
  4:5 down to 1:40 in the course of about 1,400,000 generations where the
  mimetic resemblance is already established. Such a form of selection
  entails the death of but one additional non-mimetic in 100,000 in each
  generation. If, however, the mimetic resemblance is not fully established
  and the mimic bears only what supporters of the mimicry theory term a
  "rough" resemblance to the model, it is clear that it will have far less
  chance of being mistaken for the model. Its advantage as compared with
  the non-mimetic form will be very much less. Even supposing that the
  slight variations concerned are inherited, an intensity of selection
  which would produce a certain change in 1,400,000 generations where a
  mimetic resemblance is already established must be supposed to take an
  enormously greater time where an approach to a model has to take place
  from a "rough" resemblance.</p>

  <p>From the data as to the relative proportions of the polymorphic
  females of <i>P. polytes</i> during the past and at present, and from the
  behaviour of their different forms in breeding, the following conclusions
  only can be drawn. Either natural selection, from the point of view of
  mimicry, is non-existent for this species in Ceylon, or else it is so
  slight as to be unable in half a <!-- Page 101 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page101"></a>{101}</span>century to produce an
  appreciable diminution in the proportion of non-mimetic females. For even
  if the mimetic resemblance brings about but the survival of one
  additional protected form in 100 as compared with the unprotected, this
  means a marked diminution in the proportion of <i>M</i> females in 50
  years&mdash;a diminution such as there are no grounds for supposing to
  have taken place.</p>

  <p>It has been argued that in populations exhibiting Mendelian heredity
  even a relatively low selection rate must bring about a rapid change in
  the constitution of a mixed population. Have we any grounds for supposing
  that populations of this sort can undergo such rapid changes? In cases
  where mimetic resemblances are involved we have no examples of the sort.
  But some interesting evidence as to the rate at which a population may
  change is to be gathered from the study of melanism in certain moths. It
  is well known that in some parts of England the common peppered moth,
  <i>Amphidasys betularia</i> has been almost entirely supplanted by the
  darker melanic form <i>doubledayaria</i>. It first made its appearance
  near Manchester in 1850, and from that centre has been gradually
  spreading over northern England, the Midlands, and the south-eastern
  counties. At Huddersfield, for instance, fifty years ago only the type
  form <i>betularia</i> existed; to-day there is nothing but
  <i>doubledayaria</i>. In Lancashire and Cheshire the type is now rare. On
  the continent, too, there is the same story to be told. The melanic form
  first appeared in Rhenish <!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page102"></a>{102}</span>Prussia in 1888; to-day it is much more
  abundant than the older type. There, too, it is spreading eastwards and
  southwards to Thuringia, to Saxony, to Silesia. What advantage this new
  dark form has over the older one we do not know<a name="footnotetag52"
  href="#footnote52"><sup>[52]</sup></a>. Some advantage, however, it must
  have, otherwise it could hardly supplant <i>betularia</i> in the way that
  it is doing. From our present standpoint two things are of interest in
  the case of the peppered moth&mdash;the rapidity with which the change in
  the nature of the population has taken place, and the fact that the two
  forms exhibit Mendelian heredity, <i>doubledayaria</i> being dominant and
  <i>betularia</i> recessive<a name="footnotetag53"
  href="#footnote53"><sup>[53]</sup></a>. Moreover, mixed broods have been
  reared from wild females of both sorts, and so far as is known the two
  forms breed freely together where they co-exist. This case of the
  peppered moth shews how swiftly a change may come over a species<a
  name="footnotetag54" href="#footnote54"><sup>[54]</sup></a>. It is not at
  all improbable that the establishing of a new variety at the expense of
  an older one in a relatively short space of time is continually going on,
  especially in tropical lands where <!-- Page 103 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page103"></a>{103}</span>the conditions appear
  to be more favourable to exuberance of variation and where generations
  succeed one another in more rapid succession. At present, however, we are
  without data. A form reported by an old collector as common is now rare;
  a variety once regarded as a great prize is now easily to be found. Such
  to-day is the sort of information available. For the solution of our
  problem it is, of course, useless. The development of Mendelian studies
  has given us a method, rough perhaps but the best yet found, of testing
  for the presence, and of measuring the intensity, of natural selection.
  Much could be learned if some common form were chosen for investigation
  in which, as in <i>P. polytes</i>, there are both mimetic and non-mimetic
  forms. Large numbers should be caught at stated intervals, large enough
  to give trustworthy data as to the proportions of the different forms,
  mimetic or non-mimetic, that occurred in the population. Such a census of
  a polymorphic species, if done thoroughly, and done over a series of
  years at regular intervals, might be expected to give us the necessary
  data for deciding whether the relative proportion of the different forms
  was changing&mdash;whether there were definite grounds for supposing
  natural selection to be at work, and if so what was the rate at which it
  brought the change about.</p>

<h5>CHAPTER IX</h5>

<h5 class="scac">THE ENEMIES OF BUTTERFLIES</h5>

  <p>The theory of mimicry demands that butterflies should have enemies,
  and further that those enemies should exercise a certain discrimination
  in their attacks. They must be sufficiently observant to notice the
  difference between the mimetic and the non-mimetic form; they must be
  sufficiently unobservant to confuse the mimetic form with the unpalatable
  model. And, of course, they must have enough sense of taste to dislike
  the unpalatable and to appreciate the palatable varieties. What these
  enemies are and whether they can be supposed to play the part required of
  them we may now go on to consider.</p>

  <p>Butterflies are destroyed in the imago state principally by three
  groups of enemies&mdash;predaceous insects, lizards, and birds. It is
  known that monkeys also devour butterflies to some extent, but such
  damage as they inflict is almost certainly small in comparison with that
  brought about by the three groups already mentioned. In view of the very
  different nature of these groups it will be convenient to consider them
  separately. <!-- Page 105 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page105"></a>{105}</span></p>

  <p>I. <i>Predaceous Insects.</i> Butterflies are known to be preyed upon
  by other insects of different orders, and a considerable number of
  observations have recently been gathered together from various sources
  and put on record by Professor Poulton<a name="footnotetag55"
  href="#footnote55"><sup>[55]</sup></a>. These observations shew that
  butterflies may be devoured by mantids, dragon-flies, and blood-sucking
  flies of the families Empiidae and Asilidae. For mantids the records are
  scanty, but they have been observed to kill presumably distasteful forms
  as often as those which are considered palatable. An interesting set of
  experiments was made by G. A. K. Marshall on captive mantids in Africa<a
  name="footnotetag56" href="#footnote56"><sup>[56]</sup></a>. Of the
  eleven individuals representing several species with which he
  experimented, some ate every butterfly offered, including the distasteful
  Danaines and Acraeines. Others, however, shewed some distaste of the
  Acraeines and would not devour them so freely as butterflies of other
  species. There are no grounds, however, for supposing that the mantids
  had any appreciation of the warning coloration of the Acraeines. Whether
  completely eaten or not the Acraeines were apparently sufficiently
  damaged to prevent their taking any further part in the propagation of
  their species. Warning coloration is not of much service to its possessor
  who has to be tasted and partially eaten before being eventually
  rejected. Even if some mantids shew distaste of certain unpalatable
  butterflies, that distaste is probably seldom <!-- Page 106 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page106"></a>{106}</span>exercised with a
  gentleness sufficient to ensure that the butterfly reaps the reward of
  its disagreeable nature. And unless, of course, the butterfly is allowed
  to do so the enemy can play no part in the production or maintenance of a
  mimetic resemblance.</p>

  <p>What is true for mantids is probably also true for the other groups of
  predaceous insects. Dragon-flies and wasps have been recorded as
  attacking the distasteful as well as butterflies of unprotected groups.
  Among the most serious enemies of butterflies must probably be reckoned
  the blood-sucking Asilids. These powerful and ferocious flies seize
  butterflies on the wing with their strong claws and plunge their
  proboscis into the thorax. Apparently they inject some swift poison, for
  the butterfly is instantly paralysed, nor is there any sign of struggle.
  The Asilid flies off with its victim, sucking the juices as it goes.
  There can be no doubt in the mind of any one who has watched these
  creatures hawking butterflies that their natural gifts are such as to
  enable them to exercise discrimination in their food. Most insect life is
  at their mercy but they appear to exercise no choice, seizing and
  devouring the first flying thing that comes within easy reach. Certainly
  as regards butterflies palatability or the reverse makes no difference,
  and they are known to feed indiscriminately both upon the evil-flavoured
  and upon the good. Taking it all together the evidence is such that we
  cannot suppose predaceous insects to pay any attention to warning
  colours, and, therefore, we cannot regard them as playing any part in
  connection with mimetic resemblance. <!-- Page 107 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>{107}</span></p>

  <p>II. <i>Lizards.</i> In those parts of the world where lizards of
  larger size are abundant there is plenty of evidence that certain species
  are very destructive to butterfly life. As might be expected this is
  especially true of forms which are either arboreal or semi-arboreal in
  habit. Among the reptiles of Ceylon, for example, are several species of
  the genus <i>Calotes</i>, of which two, <i>C. ophiomachus</i> and <i>C.
  versicolor</i>, are particularly abundant. In appearance and habits they
  are not unlike chameleons though far more active in their movements. Like
  chameleons, too, they are able to change colour, and the fact that they
  can assume a brilliant scarlet hue about the head and neck has probably
  led to their popular name of "blood-suckers." It is not impossible that
  the assumption of this scarlet coloration may serve as a lure to bring
  insects within range. These lizards have often been observed to seize and
  devour butterflies. Moreover, it is a common thing to find butterflies
  with a large semi-circular patch bitten out of the hind wings, and there
  is little doubt but that such injuries have been inflicted by lizards.
  There is, however, no evidence to suggest that they exercise any
  discrimination in their choice of the butterflies which they attack. This
  is borne out by their behaviour towards various species offered to them,
  both when at liberty and when caged. In an ingenious series of
  experiments Col. Manders brought various butterflies within reach of a
  <i>Calotes</i> by the help of a fishing-rod and a long line of fine silk,
  by this means simulating natural conditions as far as possible. <!-- Page
  108 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"></a>{108}</span>He found
  that the lizards ate the so-called distasteful forms such as <i>Danais
  chrysippus</i>, <i>Euploea core</i>, <i>Acraea violae</i>, and <i>Papilio
  hector</i>, as readily as the presumably more palatable forms<a
  name="footnotetag57" href="#footnote57"><sup>[57]</sup></a>. In
  captivity, too, they will take any butterfly as readily as another.
  Experiments by Finn<a name="footnotetag58"
  href="#footnote58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> and by the writer<a
  name="footnotetag59" href="#footnote59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> proved that
  they ate Danaids, Euploeas, and <i>Papilio aristolochiae</i> without any
  hesitation so long as the insects were alive and moving. When, too, a
  mixture of different species, some with and some without warning
  coloration, was given to them all were eaten, nor was there any
  discrimination evidenced in the order in which they were taken. The
  lizard simply took the first that came within reach and went on until the
  whole lot was devoured, wings and all.</p>

  <p>Some experiments by Miss Pritchett on the American lizard
  <i>Sceleporus floridanus</i> point to the same conclusion<a
  name="footnotetag60" href="#footnote60"><sup>[60]</sup></a>. She found
  that it took without hesitation any butterfly offered to it including the
  presumably distasteful models <i>Danais archippus</i> and <i>Papilio
  philenor</i> (cf. pp. <a href="#page45">45</a> and <a
  href="#page49">49</a>). On the other hand, another species of lizard with
  which Miss Pritchett experimented, <i>Gerrhonotus infernalis</i>, refused
  all the butterflies offered to it, though it fed freely on Orthopterous
  insects as well as on spiders and scorpions.</p>

  <p>It seems clear from these various observations and <!-- Page 109
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"></a>{109}</span>experiments
  that certain lizards devour butterflies freely, but that they do not
  exercise any discrimination in the species which they attack. All are
  caught and devoured indiscriminately, so that in spite of the fact that
  such lizards are among the most serious enemies of butterflies we cannot
  suppose them to play any part in establishing a mimetic resemblance.</p>

  <p>III. <i>Birds.</i> The relations which exist between butterflies and
  their bird enemies have for many years been the subject of keen
  discussion. It is generally recognised that if mimetic resemblances
  become established through the agency of discriminating enemies those
  enemies must be birds. Hence those interested in the question of mimicry
  have for some years past turned their attention to birds more than to the
  other enemies of butterflies. That many birds systematically feed on
  butterflies is a fact that does not admit of doubt. It is true that, as
  Mr Marshall points out in the valuable paper in which he has summarised
  the evidence<a name="footnotetag61"
  href="#footnote61"><sup>[61]</sup></a>, observations of birds eating
  butterflies are relatively scanty. Though, as he points out, this is
  equally true for other groups of insects besides butterflies, bird
  attacks on butterflies, owing to the conspicuous nature of the victim,
  are much more likely to attract attention than attacks on other groups.
  We are still without much information as to the extent to which birds
  destroy butterflies and as to whether they shew any decided preference
  for certain species over others. A careful examination of the contents of
  the <!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page110"></a>{110}</span>stomachs of large numbers of insectivorous
  birds in a tropical area would go some way towards deciding the matter,
  but at present such information is lacking. We have to rely upon the
  existing observations of birds attacking butterflies in the wild state,
  and upon certain feeding experiments made with captive birds.</p>

  <p>Observations on birds attacking butterflies where mimetic forms occur
  have been made almost entirely in certain parts of Africa, in India, and
  in Ceylon. For Africa, Marshall has collected some forty-six observations
  of which almost half are concerned with Pierines. The remainder include
  four instances of attacks on species of <i>Acraea</i>, a genus which on
  the mimicry theory must be regarded as among the most unpalatable of
  butterflies.</p>

  <p>The records from the Indo-Malayan region (principally India and
  Ceylon) are somewhat more numerous and here again more than one-third of
  them refer to Pierines. Among the others are records of the distasteful
  forms <i>Euploea core</i>, <i>E. rafflesii</i>, <i>Acraea violae</i>, and
  <i>Papilio hector</i> being taken and devoured.</p>

  <p>There is one interesting record which seems to suggest that Swinhoe's
  Bee-Eater (<i>Melittophagus swinhoei</i>) may exercise that
  discrimination in the butterflies it attacks which is demanded on the
  mimicry theory. Lt.-Col. Bingham on one occasion in Burma noticed this
  species hawking butterflies. He records that they took <i>Papilio
  erithonius</i>, <i>P. sarpedon</i>, <i>Charaxes athamas</i>, <i>Cyrestis
  thyodamas</i>, and <i>Terias hecabe</i>, and probably also species of the
  genera <i>Prioneris</i>, <i>Hebomoia</i> (Pierines), <!-- Page 111
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111"></a>{111}</span><i>Junonia</i>
  and <i>Precis</i> (Vanessids). And he goes on to say: "I also
  particularly noticed that the birds never went for a <i>Danais</i> or
  <i>Euploea</i>, or for <i>Papilio macareus</i> and <i>P. xenocles</i>,
  which are mimics of Danais, though two or three species of <i>Danais</i>,
  four or five of <i>Euploea</i>, and the two above-mentioned mimicking
  <i>Papilios</i> simply swarmed along the whole road<a
  name="footnotetag62" href="#footnote62"><sup>[62]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p>Marshall also quotes a case of attack by a green bee-eater on a
  <i>Danais</i> in which the butterfly was caught and subsequently
  rejected, after which it flew away. Little stress, however, can be laid
  upon this case in view of the more recent data brought together by Col.
  Manders and Mr Fryer. Discussing the attacks of birds on butterflies in
  Southern India and Ceylon, Col. Manders gives the following quotation<a
  name="footnotetag63" href="#footnote63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> from a letter
  of Mr T. N. Hearsy, Indian Forest Service:</p>

  <p>"Coimbatore, 6. 6. 10.... I have frequently seen the common green
  bee-eater (<i>Merops viridis</i>) and the king-crow (<i>Buchanga
  atra</i>) take butterflies on the wing, the butterflies being
  <i>Catopsilia pyranthe</i>, <i>C. florella</i>, <i>Terias hecabe</i> and
  <i>Papilio demoleus</i>. The bee-eater I have also seen taking <i>Danais
  chrysippus</i> and <i>Danais septentrionis</i>, and I remember to have
  been struck with their taste for those latter...."</p>

  <p>Col. Manders also brings forward evidence for these Danaids and
  Euploeas being eaten by Drongos and by the paradise flycatcher. Still
  more recently an interesting contribution to the matter has been made by
  <!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page112"></a>{112}</span>Mr J. C. F. Fryer<a name="footnotetag64"
  href="#footnote64"><sup>[64]</sup></a>. The Ashy Wood-swallow (<i>Artamus
  fuscus</i>) had been recorded on two occasions as having attacked
  <i>Euploea core</i>. Mr Fryer was fortunate in coming across this bird in
  the gardens at Peradeniya, near Kandy, at a time when <i>Euploea core</i>
  and <i>Danais septentrionis</i> were particularly abundant, and he
  watched a number of them systematically hawking these presumably
  unpalatable species. As he observes, "in Ceylon a resemblance to the
  genera <i>Danais</i> and <i>Euploea</i> is doubtfully of value; in fact
  in the neighbourhood of Wood-swallows it is a distinct danger." Fryer
  also noted that the mimetic forms of <i>P. polytes</i> were taken as well
  as the non-mimetic.</p>

  <p>For tropical Central and South America, that other great region where
  mimetic forms are numerous, there are unfortunately hardly any records of
  butterflies attacked by birds. Bates stated that the Pierines were much
  persecuted by birds, and his statement is confirmed by Hahnel, but exact
  observations for this region are remarkably scanty. Belt observed a pair
  of birds bring butterflies and dragon-flies to their young, and noticed
  that they brought no Heliconii to the nest although these swarmed in the
  neighbourhood<a name="footnotetag65"
  href="#footnote65"><sup>[65]</sup></a>. On the other hand, Mr W. Schaus<a
  name="footnotetag66" href="#footnote66"><sup>[66]</sup></a>, from an
  experience of many years spent in the forests of Central America,
  considers that the butterflies of this region are hardly, if ever,
  attacked by birds. <!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page113"></a>{113}</span></p>

  <p>For North America Marshall records over 80 cases of birds attacking
  butterflies. Among them is an interesting record of a bird seizing and
  rejecting a specimen of <i>Anosia plexippus</i> (= <i>Danais
  archippus</i>), one of the few Danaines found in this region.</p>

  <p>It must be admitted that the data at present available with regard to
  the attacks of birds upon butterflies under natural conditions are too
  meagre to allow of our coming to definite conclusions on the points at
  issue. It is safe to say that a number of species of birds have been
  known to attack butterflies&mdash;that a few out of the number feed upon
  butterflies systematically&mdash;that some of the most persistent bird
  enemies devour the presumably protected forms as freely as the
  unprotected&mdash;but that in a few instances there is some reason for
  supposing that the bird discriminates. Beyond this it is unsafe to go at
  present.</p>

  <p>In attempting to come to a decision as to the part played by birds in
  the destruction of butterflies an evident desideratum is a knowledge of
  the contents of the stomachs of freshly killed birds. Unfortunately few
  systematic observations of this nature exist. G. L. Bates<a
  name="footnotetag67" href="#footnote67"><sup>[67]</sup></a>, when
  collecting in the Southern Cameroons, noted the stomach contents of a
  considerable number of birds. The remains of beetles were recognised in
  213 cases: Orthoptera in 177: ants in 57 (mostly in stomachs of birds of
  the genus <i>Dendromus</i>): other Hymenoptera in 8: coccids in 32: bugs
  in 19: white ants in 31: slugs and snails in 24: spiders in 85 <!-- Page
  114 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114"></a>{114}</span>(mostly in
  Sunbirds): millipedes in 20; but in no single instance were the remains
  of butterflies found. More recently Bates' account has been criticized by
  Swynnerton<a name="footnotetag68" href="#footnote68"><sup>[68]</sup></a>
  who comments on the difficulty of identifying butterfly remains as
  compared with those of beetles and grasshoppers. He states that the
  pellets ejected by captive birds after a meal of butterflies contain only
  fine debris which is very difficult to identify. Further, he found that
  of twenty small bird excreta collected in the forest no less than
  eighteen contained scales and small wing fragments of Lepidoptera.</p>

  <p>Some attention has been paid to the relation between birds and
  butterflies in the United States, and under the auspices of the
  Department of Agriculture a large number of birds' stomachs have been
  investigated. Careful examination of some 40,000 stomachs of birds shot
  in their natural habitats resulted in the discovery of butterfly remains
  in but four. It cannot, therefore, be supposed that birds play much part
  in connection with such mimetic resemblances as are found in North
  America (cf. pp. <a href="#page45">45</a>-<a href="#page49">49</a>).
  Nevertheless, it is known that on occasion large numbers of butterflies
  may be destroyed by birds. An interesting case is described by Bryant<a
  name="footnotetag69" href="#footnote69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> of an
  outbreak in North California of <i>Eugonia californica</i>, a close
  relative of the tortoiseshell. The butterfly was so abundant as to be a
  plague, and five species of birds took advantage of its great abundance
  to prey largely upon it. From <!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page115"></a>{115}</span>his examination of the stomachs Bryant
  came to the conclusion that some 30% of the food of these five species
  was composed of this butterfly. The stomachs of many other species were
  examined without ever encountering butterfly remains. Nor did field
  observations support the view that any species, other than the five
  specially noted, ever attacked these butterflies. The case is of interest
  in the present discussion as evidence that the identification of
  butterfly remains in the stomachs of birds is by no means so difficult as
  some observers suggest.</p>

  <p>Besides this evidence derived from observations upon birds in the wild
  state some data have been accumulated from the experimental feeding of
  birds in captivity. Of such experiments the most extensive are those of
  Finn<a name="footnotetag70" href="#footnote70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> in
  South India. He experimented with a number of species of insectivorous
  birds belonging to different groups. Of these he found that some, among
  which may be mentioned the King-crow, Starling, and Liothrix<a
  name="footnotetag71" href="#footnote71"><sup>[71]</sup></a>, objected to
  Danaines, <i>Papilio aristolochiae</i> and <i>Delias eucharis</i>, a
  presumably distasteful Pierine with bright red markings on the under
  surface of the hind wings (<a href="#plateII">Pl. II</a>, fig. 1). In
  some cases the bird refused these forms altogether, while in others they
  were eaten in the absence of more palatable forms. The different species
  of birds often differed in <!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page116"></a>{116}</span>their behaviour towards these three
  "nauseous" forms. The Hornbill, for example, refused the Danaines and
  <i>P. aristolochiae</i> absolutely, but ate <i>Delias eucharis</i>. Some
  species again, notably the Bulbuls (<i>Molpastes</i>) and Mynahs, shewed
  little or no discrimination, but devoured the "protected" as readily as
  the "unprotected" forms. Finn also states that "<i>Papilio polytes</i>
  was not very generally popular with birds, but much preferred to its
  model, <i>P. aristolochiae</i>."</p>

  <p>In many of Finn's experiments both model and mimic were given to the
  birds simultaneously so that they had a choice, and he says that "in
  several cases I saw the birds apparently deceived by mimicking
  butterflies. The Common Babbler was deceived by <i>Nepheronia
  hippia</i><a name="footnotetag72" href="#footnote72"><sup>[72]</sup></a>
  and Liothrix by <i>Hypolimnas misippus</i>. The latter bird saw through
  the disguise of the mimetic <i>Papilio polites</i>, which, however, was
  sufficient to deceive the Bhimraj and King-crow. I doubt if any bird was
  impressed by the mimetic appearance of the female <i>Elymnias
  undularis</i>" (cf. <a href="#plateIV">Pl. IV</a>, fig. 5). Finn
  concluded from his experiments that on the whole they tended to support
  the theory of Bates and Wallace, though he admits that the unpalatable
  forms were commonly taken without the stimulus of actual hunger and
  generally without signs of dislike. Certainly it is as well to be
  cautious in drawing conclusions from experiments with captive birds. The
  King-crow, for instance, according to Finn shewed a marked dislike for
  Danaines in captivity; yet Manders records this <!-- Page 117 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>{117}</span>species as feeding upon
  Danaines under natural conditions (cf. p. <a
  href="#page111">111</a>).</p>

  <p>A few further experiments with the birds of this region were carried
  out by Manders<a name="footnotetag73"
  href="#footnote73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> in Ceylon. The results are perhaps
  to be preferred to Finn's, as the birds were at liberty. Manders found
  that the Brown Shrike (<i>Lanius cristatus</i>) would take butterflies
  which were pinned to a paling. In this way it made off with the mimetic
  females of <i>Hypolimnas bolina</i> and <i>H. misippus</i>, as well as
  with <i>Danais chrysippus</i> and <i>Acraea violae</i> which were
  successively offered to it. Evidently this species had no repugnance to
  unpalatable forms. Manders also found that a young Mynah allowed complete
  liberty in a large garden would eat such forms as <i>Acraea violae</i>
  and <i>Papilio hector</i>. As the result of his experience Manders
  considers that the unpalatability of butterflies exhibiting warning
  coloration has been assumed on insufficient data, and he is further
  inclined to doubt whether future investigations will reveal any marked
  preference in those birds which are mainly instrumental in the
  destruction of butterflies.</p>

  <p>A few experiments on feeding birds with South African butterflies are
  recorded by Marshall. A young Kestrel (<i>Cerchneis naumanni</i>) was fed
  from time to time with various species of butterflies. In most cases the
  butterflies offered were eaten even when they were species of
  <i>Acraea</i>. On the other hand <i>Danais chrysippus</i> was generally
  rejected after being partly <!-- Page 118 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page118"></a>{118}</span>devoured. When first offered this
  unpalatable species was taken readily and it was only after it had been
  tasted that the bird rejected it. When offered on several subsequent
  occasions it was partly eaten each time, and the behaviour of the Kestrel
  did not suggest that it associated a disagreeable flavour even with this
  conspicuous pattern. Another young Kestrel (<i>Cerchneis
  rupicoloides</i>) was also used for experiment. At first it would not
  take butterflies and at no time did it shew any fondness for them. Indeed
  it is doubtful from the way in which they seem to have shaped at the
  insects whether either of these Kestrels had had any experience of
  butterflies before the experiments began.</p>

  <p>A Ground Hornbill with which Marshall also experimented ate various
  species, including <i>Acraea</i>, but, after crushing it, refused the
  only <i>Danais chrysippus</i> offered. It is hardly likely that this
  large omnivorous bird operates as a selecting agent in cases of
  mimicry.</p>

  <p>In an interesting paper published recently McAtee<a
  name="footnotetag74" href="#footnote74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> discusses the
  value of feeding experiments with animals in captivity as a means of
  indicating their preference for different articles of diet. After
  reviewing the various evidence brought forward he concludes that the food
  accepted or rejected by captive animals is very little guide to its
  preferences under natural conditions. He points out that a bird in
  captivity not infrequently rejects what is known to form a main staple of
  its diet in nature, and that conversely it may eagerly accept something
  which, in the wild state, it <!-- Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page119"></a>{119}</span>would have no opportunity of obtaining.
  Great caution must, therefore, be exercised in the interpretation of
  feeding experiments made with birds in captivity.</p>

  <p>It appears to be generally assumed that colour perception in birds is
  similar to what it is among human beings, but some experiments made by
  Hess<a name="footnotetag75" href="#footnote75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> render
  it very doubtful whether this is really the case. In one of these
  experiments a row of cooked white grains of rice was illuminated by the
  whole series of spectral colours from violet to deep red. Hens which had
  been previously kept in the dark so that their eyes were adapted to light
  of low intensity were then allowed to feed on the spectral rice. The
  grains illuminated by green, yellow, and red were quickly taken, but the
  very dark red, the violet, and the blue were left, presumably because the
  birds were unable to perceive them. Again, when the birds were given a
  patch of rice grains of which half was feebly illuminated by red light
  and the other half more strongly by blue light, they took the red but
  left the blue. Previous experiment had shewn that with ordinary white
  light the birds always started on the best illuminated grains. It seems
  reasonable to conclude, therefore, that in the red-blue experiment the
  feebly illuminated red grains were more visible than the far more
  strongly lighted blue ones. It might be objected that the birds had a
  prejudice against blue, but, as Hess points out, this is almost certainly
  not the case because they took grains <!-- Page 120 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page120"></a>{120}</span>which were very
  strongly illuminated with blue. Results of a similar nature were also
  obtained from pigeons, and from a kestrel which was fed with pieces of
  meat lighted with different colours.</p>

  <p>On the whole these experiments of Hess convey a strong suggestion that
  the colour perceptions of birds may be quite different from our own, more
  especially where blue is concerned. Great caution is needed in discussing
  instances of mimicry in their relation to the bird, for we have no right
  to assume that the bird sees things as we do. On the other hand, it is a
  matter of much interest to find that in general blue plays relatively
  little part in cases of mimetic resemblance among butterflies; some
  combination of a dark tint with either red, white, brown, or yellow being
  far more common.</p>

  <p>It will probably be admitted by most people that the evidence, taken
  all together, is hardly sufficient for ascribing to birds that part in
  the establishing of a mimetic likeness which is required on the theory of
  mimicry. That birds destroy butterflies in considerable numbers is
  certainly true, but it is no less true that some of the most destructive
  birds appear to exercise no choice in the species of butterfly attacked.
  They simply take what comes first and is easiest to catch. It is probably
  for this reason that the Wood-swallow feeds chiefly on Euploeines and
  Danaines (cf. p. <a href="#page112">112</a>). It is probably for this
  reason also that such a large proportion of the records of attacks on
  butterflies under natural conditions refer to the Pierines; for owing to
  <!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page121"></a>{121}</span>their light colour it is probable that the
  "Whites" are more conspicuous and offer a better mark for a bird in
  pursuit than darker coloured species.</p>

  <p><i>Mammals.</i> Apart from man it is clear that only such mammals as
  are of arboreal habits are likely to cause destruction among butterflies
  in the imago state. Apparently there are no records of any arboreal
  mammal, except monkeys, capturing butterflies in the wild state, nor is
  there much evidence available from feeding experiments. But such evidence
  as exists is of considerable interest. As the result of feeding
  butterflies of different sorts to an Indian Tree-shrew (<i>Tupaia
  ferruginea</i>) Finn<a name="footnotetag76"
  href="#footnote76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> found that it shewed a strong
  dislike to Danaids and to <i>Papilio aristolochiae</i> though it took
  readily <i>Papilio demoleus</i>, <i>Neptis kamarupa</i>, and
  <i>Catopsilia</i> (a Pierine). It is fairly certain that if the
  Tree-shrew is an enemy of butterflies in the wild state it is a
  discriminating one.</p>

  <p>The other mammals with which experiments have been made are the common
  baboon, a monkey (<i>Cercopithecus pygerythrus</i>), and a mongoose
  (<i>Herpestes galera</i>)&mdash;all by Marshall<a name="footnotetag77"
  href="#footnote77"><sup>[77]</sup></a> in South Africa. The mongoose
  experiments were few and inconclusive, nor is this a matter of much
  moment as it is unlikely that this mammal is a serious enemy of
  butterflies.</p>

  <p>The monkey ate various forms of <i>Precis</i> (a Vanessid), after
  which it was given <i>Acraea halali</i>. This distasteful form was
  "accepted without suspicion, but when <!-- Page 122 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>{122}</span>the monkey put it into
  his mouth, he at once took it out again and looked at it with the utmost
  surprise for some seconds, and then threw it away. He would have nothing
  to do with an <i>Acraea caldarena</i> which I then offered him<a
  name="footnotetag78" href="#footnote78"><sup>[78]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p>The experiments with the baboons were more extensive. Two species of
  <i>Acraea</i>, <i>halali</i> and <i>axina</i>, were recognised when first
  offered and refused untasted. <i>Danais chrysippus</i>, on the other
  hand, was tasted on being offered for the first time, and then rejected.
  This species was twice offered subsequently and tasted each time before
  being rejected. When offered the fourth time it was rejected at sight.
  The baboon evidently learned to associate an unpleasant taste with the
  <i>chrysippus</i> pattern. At this stage it would have been interesting
  to have offered it some well-known mimic of <i>chrysippus</i>, such as
  the female of <i>Hypolimnas misippus</i> or the <i>trophonius</i> form of
  <i>Papilio dardanus</i>, but this experiment was unfortunately not made.
  Marshall did, however, offer it at the same time a specimen each of
  <i>Byblia ilithyia</i> (a Vanessid) and of <i>Acraea axina</i> to which
  it bears a general resemblance. The baboon took the former but neglected
  the latter altogether. The general resemblance between the two species
  was not sufficiently close to deceive it.</p>

  <p>These experiments with mammals, though few in number, are of unusual
  interest. Should they be substantiated by further work it is not
  impossible <!-- Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page123"></a>{123}</span>that, as a factor in the establishing of a
  mimetic likeness, a stronger case may be made out for the monkey than the
  bird. The monkey apparently eats butterflies readily<a
  name="footnotetag79" href="#footnote79"><sup>[79]</sup></a>: owing
  probably to a keener sense of smell it shews far less hesitation as to
  its likes and dislikes: its intelligence is such that one can easily
  imagine it exercising the necessary powers of discrimination; in short it
  is the ideal enemy for which advocates of the mimicry theory have been
  searching&mdash;if only it could fly. As things are its butterfly
  captures must be made when the insect is at rest, probably near sunrise
  and sunset, and this leads to a difficulty. Most butterflies rest with
  their wings closed. In many of the well-known cases of mimicry the
  pattern on the under surface of the mimic's wings which would meet the
  monkey's eye is quite different from that of its model. It is difficult
  in such cases to imagine the monkey operating as a factor in establishing
  a resemblance between the upper surfaces of the wings of the two
  unrelated species. On the other hand, some butterflies, <!-- Page 124
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"></a>{124}</span><i>e.g.</i>
  <i>Papilio polytes</i>, rest with wings outspread, and there are rare
  cases, such as that of <i>P. laglaizei</i> (p. 27), where the most
  striking point about the resemblance is only to be appreciated when the
  insects are at rest with their wings closed. In such cases it is
  conceivable that the monkey may play a part in the elimination of the
  non-mimetic elements of a palatable species which at the same time
  possessed a mimetic form closely resembling another species disagreeable
  to the monkey's taste. As has been pointed out earlier (p. <a
  href="#page96">96</a>) even a slight persecution directed with adequate
  discrimination will in time bring about a marked result where the mimetic
  likeness is already in existence. It is not impossible therefore that the
  establishing of such a likeness may often be due more to the
  discrimination of the monkey than to the mobility of the bird.</p>

<h5>CHAPTER X</h5>

<h5 class="scac">MIMICRY AND VARIATION</h5>

  <p>It is clear from the last few chapters that the theory of mimicry in
  butterflies with its interpretation of the building up of these
  likenesses by means of natural selection in the form of predaceous birds
  and other foes is open to destructive criticism from several points of
  view. The evidence from mimicry rings makes it almost certain that in
  some cases the resemblance must be founded on an initial variation of
  such magnitude that the mimic could straightway be confused with the
  model. Till the mimic can be mistaken for the model natural selection
  plays no part. The evidence from breeding suggests strongly that in
  certain cases (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Papilio polytes</i>) the likeness arose in
  the form in which we know it to-day. In such cases there is no reason for
  supposing that natural selection has had anything to do with the
  formation of the finished mimic. Considerations of this nature may be
  said to have destroyed the view, current until quite recently, that in
  the formation of a mimetic resemblance the exclusive agent was natural
  selection. During the past few years it has come to be admitted by the
  staunchest upholders of the theory of mimicry that natural <!-- Page 126
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page126"></a>{126}</span>selection
  would not come into play until the would-be mimic was sufficiently like
  the model to be confused with it under natural conditions<a
  name="footnotetag80" href="#footnote80"><sup>[80]</sup></a>. The part now
  often attributed to natural selection is to put a polish on the
  resemblance and to keep it up to the mark by weeding out those which do
  not reach the required standard. It is supposed that if natural selection
  ceases to operate the mimetic resemblance is gradually lost owing to the
  appearance of variations which are no longer weeded out. An interesting
  case has recently been brought forward by Carpenter<a
  name="footnotetag81" href="#footnote81"><sup>[81]</sup></a> and explained
  on these lines: The Nymphaline <i>Pseudacraea eurytus</i> is a
  polymorphic species found in Central Africa. In Uganda it occurs in
  several distinct forms which were originally supposed to be distinct
  species. Three of these forms bear a marked resemblance to three species
  of the Acraeine genus <i>Planema</i>.</p>

  <p>These different species occur round Victoria Nyanza and also on some
  of the islands in the lake. Some <!-- Page 127 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page127"></a>{127}</span>interesting points are
  brought out by a comparison of the occurrence and variation of the
  species on the mainland with what is found on Bugalla Island in the Sesse
  Archipelago. On the mainland the Pseudacraeas are abundant but the
  Planemas even more so, outnumbering the former by about 5:2<a
  name="footnotetag83" href="#footnote83"><sup>[83]</sup></a>. Moreover, it
  is rare to find individuals more or less intermediate between the three
  forms, though they are known to occur. On Bugalla Island, however, a
  different state of things is found. The Pseudacraeas are very abundant,
  whereas the Planemas, owing doubtless to the scarcity of their food
  plant, are relatively rare, and are very greatly outnumbered by the
  Pseudacraeas. At the same time the proportion of transitional forms among
  the Pseudacraeas is definitely higher than on the mainland. These facts
  are interpreted by Carpenter as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>On the mainland where the models are abundant there is a vigorous
  action on the part of natural selection. The mimetic forms have a strong
  advantage and the non-mimetics have been gradually weeded out. But on the
  island, where the Pseudacraeas outnumber the models, the advantage
  obtained through mimicry is not so great. The so-called transitional
  forms are little, if at all, worse off than those closely resembling the
  scarce models, and consequently have as good a chance of surviving as any
  of the typical mimetic forms. On <!-- Page 128 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page128"></a>{128}</span>the mainland, however,
  the enemies of <i>Pseudacraea</i> are well acquainted with the
  <i>Planema</i> models which are here common, and discriminate against
  individuals which are not close mimics of the Planemas. The result is
  that on the mainland transitional forms are scarcer than on the island.
  Natural selection maintains a high standard for the mimetic likeness on
  the mainland owing to the abundance of the model; but when the model is
  scarce the likeness ceases to be kept up to the mark strictly, and tends
  to become lost owing to the appearance of fresh variations which are no
  longer weeded out.</p>

  <p>Here it should be stated that the various Pseudacraeas form a
  population in which the different forms mate freely with one another. In
  the few breeding experiments that Dr Carpenter was able to make he found
  that <i>obscura</i> could produce <i>terra</i>, and that
  <i>tirikensis</i> was able to give <i>obscura</i>, the male in each case
  being, of course, unknown. Far too little work has as yet been done on
  the genetics of these various forms, and it would be rash to make
  assumptions as to the nature of the intermediates until the method of
  experimental breeding has been more extensively employed in analysing
  their constitution. Possibly it is not without significance that the
  abundance or scarcity of the <i>obscura</i> form runs parallel with the
  abundance or scarcity of the intermediates. It suggests that the
  intermediates are heterozygous in some factor for which the typical
  <i>obscura</i> is homozygous, and the fact that the intermediates are
  more numerous than <!-- Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page129"></a>{129}</span><i>obscura</i> is what is to be looked for
  in a population mating at random. This case of the polymorphic
  <i>Pseudacraea eurytus</i> is one of the greatest interest, but it would
  be hazardous to draw any far-reaching deductions from such facts as are
  known at present. When the genetics of the various typical forms and of
  the intermediates has been worked out it will be disappointing if it does
  not throw clear and important light on these problems of mimetic
  resemblance.</p>

  <p>As the result of modern experimental breeding work it is recognised
  that an intermediate form between two definite varieties may be so
  because it is heterozygous for a factor for which one variety is
  homozygous and which is lacking in the other&mdash;because it has
  received from only one parent what the two typical varieties receive from
  both parents or from neither. Its germ cells, however, are such as are
  produced by the two typical forms, and the intermediate cannot be
  regarded as a stage in the evolution of one variety from the other. In
  these cases of mimicry the existence of intermediate forms does not
  entail the deduction that they have played a part in the evolution of one
  pattern from another under the influence of a given model. It is quite
  possible that the new mimetic pattern appeared suddenly as a sport and
  that the intermediates arose when the new form bred with that which was
  already in existence. But before we are acquainted with the genetic
  relationships between the various forms, both types and intermediates,
  speculation as to their origin must remain comparatively worthless. <!--

  <p>In this connection a few words on another source of variation may not
  be out of place. The patterns of butterflies are often very sensitive to
  changes in the conditions to which they are exposed during later larval
  and pupal life. Many moths and butterflies in temperate climates are
  double brooded. The eggs laid by the late summer brood hatch out,
  hibernate in the larval or pupal state, and emerge in the following
  spring. This spring brood produces the summer brood during the same year.
  In these cases it often happens that the two broods differ in appearance
  from one another, a phenomenon to which the term "Seasonal Dimorphism"
  has been applied. A well-marked instance is that of the little European
  Vanessid, <i>Araschnia levana</i>. The so-called <i>levana</i> form which
  emerges in the spring is a small black and orange-brown butterfly (<a
  href="#plateVI">Pl. VI</a>, fig. 10). From the eggs laid by this brood is
  produced another brood which emerges later on in the summer, and is, from
  its very different appearance, distinguished as the <i>prorsa</i> form
  (<a href="#plateVI">Pl. VI</a>, fig. 9). It is very much darker than the
  spring form and is characterised by white bands across the wings. The
  eggs laid by the <i>prorsa</i> form give rise to the <i>levana</i> form
  which emerges in the following spring. It has been shewn by various
  workers, and more especially by the extensive experiments of Merrifield<a
  name="footnotetag84" href="#footnote84"><sup>[84]</sup></a>, that the
  appearance of the <i>levana</i> or the <i>prorsa</i> form from any batch
  of eggs, whether laid by <i>prorsa</i> or <i>levana</i>, is dependent
  upon the conditions of temperature under <!-- Page 131 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page131"></a>{131}</span>which the later larval
  and early pupal stages are passed. By cooling appropriately at the right
  stage <i>levana</i> can be made to produce <i>levana</i> instead of the
  <i>prorsa</i> which it normally produces under summer conditions. So also
  by appropriate warming <i>prorsa</i> will give rise to <i>prorsa</i>.
  Moreover, if the conditions are properly adjusted an intermediate form
  <i>porima</i> can be produced, a form which occurs occasionally under
  natural conditions. The pattern is, in short, a function of the
  temperature to which certain earlier sensitive stages in this species are
  submitted. What is true of <i>A. levana</i> is true also of a number of
  other species. In some cases temperature is the factor that induces the
  variation. In other countries where the year is marked by wet and dry
  seasons instead of warm and cold ones moisture is the agent that brings
  about the change. In some of the South African butterflies of the genus
  <i>Precis</i> the seasonal change may be even more conspicuous than in
  <i>A. levana</i>. In <i>Precis octavia</i>, for example, the ground
  colour of the wet season form is predominantly red, while in the dry
  season form of the same species the pattern is different, blue being the
  predominating colour (cf. <a href="#plateVI">Pl. VI</a>, figs. 11 and
  12). Such examples as these are sufficient to shew how sensitive many
  butterflies are to changes in the conditions of later larval and earlier
  pupal life. The variations brought about in this way are as a rule
  smaller than in the examples chosen, but in no case are they known to be
  inherited, and in no case consequently could variation of this nature
  play any part in <!-- Page 132 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page132"></a>{132}</span>evolutionary change. Before any given
  variation can be claimed as a possible stage in the development of a
  mimetic likeness satisfactory evidence must be forthcoming that it is not
  of this nature, but that it is transmissible and independent of climatic
  and other conditions.</p>

  <p>Many species of butterflies, especially such as are found over a wide
  range, exhibit minor varieties which are characteristic of given
  localities. These minor varieties may be quite small. In <i>Danais
  chrysippus</i>, for example, African and Asiatic specimens can generally
  be distinguished. On examples from India a small spot is seen just below
  the bar on the fore wing and on the inner side of it. Eastwards towards
  China this spot tends to become larger and confluent with the white bar,
  giving rise to an L-shaped marking; westwards in Africa the spot tends to
  disappear altogether. The existence of such local races has been used as
  an argument for the hereditary transmission of very small
  variations&mdash;in the present instance the size of a small white spot<a
  name="footnotetag85" href="#footnote85"><sup>[85]</sup></a>. For if it
  can be supposed that small differences of this nature are always
  transmitted, it becomes less difficult to imagine that a mimetic
  resemblance has been brought about by a long series of very small steps.
  But before this can be admitted it is necessary to shew by experiment
  that the size of this spot is independent of environmental conditions,
  both climatic and other. Apart from temperature and moisture it is not
  improbable that the formation of <!-- Page 133 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page133"></a>{133}</span>pigment in the wings
  may depend in some degree upon the nature of the food. The larvae of
  <i>D. chrysippus</i> feed upon various Asclepiads, and it is at any rate
  conceivable that the pigment formation, and consequently the details of
  pattern, may be in slight measure affected by the plant species upon
  which they have fed. The species of food plants are more likely to be
  different at the extremities of the range of a widely distributed form
  like <i>D. chrysippus</i>, and if they are really a factor in the pattern
  it is at the extremities that we should expect to find the most distinct
  forms<a name="footnotetag86" href="#footnote86"><sup>[86]</sup></a>.
  Actually we do find this in <i>D. chrysippus</i>, though it does not, of
  course, follow that the cause suggested is the true one, or, if true, the
  only one. Of the nature of local races too little at present is known to
  enable us to lay down any generalization. We must first learn by
  experiment how far they remain constant when transported from their own
  environment and bred in the environment under which another distinct
  local race is living. The behaviour of the transported race under the
  altered conditions would help us in deciding whether any variation by
  which it is characterised had a definite hereditary basis or was merely a
  fluctuation dependent upon something in the conditions under which it had
  grown up. The decision as to whether it is hereditary or not must depend
  upon the <!-- Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page134"></a>{134}</span>test of breeding, through which alone we
  can hope to arrive at a satisfactory verdict upon any given case.</p>

  <p>The particular geographical variation which has just been considered
  happens to be a small one. But it may happen that a geographical variety
  is much more distinct. Indeed it is not impossible that butterflies which
  are at present ranked as distinct species may prove eventually to be
  different forms of the same species. Especially is this likely to be true
  of many forms in South America, of which Bates long ago remarked "that
  the suspicion of many of the species being nothing more than local
  modifications of other forms has proved to be well founded." Since Bates'
  day more material has been forthcoming<a name="footnotetag87"
  href="#footnote87"><sup>[87]</sup></a> and it has been shewn that certain
  colour schemes are characteristic of distinct geographical regions in
  South America where they may occur in species belonging to very different
  genera and families. In Central America, for example, the pattern common
  to many species is determined by horizontal and oblique black bands on a
  bright fulvous brown ground, with two broken yellow bars towards the tip
  of the fore wing. The general type is well shewn by <i>Mechanitis
  saturata</i> and the female of <i>Dismorphia praxinoe</i> (<a
  href="#plateX">Pl. X</a>, figs. 7 and 3). Belonging to this pattern group
  are a number of different species belonging to various families,
  including several Heliconines and Ithomiines, Pierids such as
  <i>Dismorphia</i> and <i>Perrhybris</i>, Nymphalines of the genera
  <i>Eresia</i> and <!-- Page 135 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page135"></a>{135}</span><i>Protogonius</i>, and other forms. In
  Eastern Brazil the predominant pattern is one characterised by a yellow
  band across the hind wing and a white or yellow apical fore wing marking
  (cf. <a href="#plateXV">Pl. XV</a>, figs. 3 and 8). Here also, with the
  exception of the <i>Perrhybris</i>, all the various genera which figured
  in the last group are again represented. It is true that the members of
  this second group are regarded as belonging to different species from
  those of the first group, but as species here are made by the systematist
  chiefly, if not entirely, on the colour pattern this fact may not mean
  much. Passing now to Ega on the Upper Amazons the general ground colour
  is a deep chestnut purple and the apical area of the fore wings presents
  a much mottled appearance (cf. <a href="#plateXV">Pl. XV</a>, figs. 4 and
  9). In this group again we find represented the different genera found in
  the other groups, the only notable absentees being <i>Eresia</i> and
  <i>Perrhybris</i>. Lastly in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia the general
  pattern scheme consists of orange-tawny markings on a black ground (cf.
  <a href="#plateXV">Pl. XV</a>, figs. 5 and 10). This group differs
  somewhat in composition from the preceding in that it contains no Pierid
  and no Danaid. On the other hand its numbers have been strengthened by
  the accession of a <i>Papilio</i>, an <i>Acraea</i>, and two species of
  the Satyrid genus <i>Pedaliodes</i>. Certain writers have seen in the
  theory of mimicry the only explanation of these peculiar geographical
  pattern groups. The fashion is in each case set by the most abundant
  form, generally an Ithomiine of the genus <i>Melinaea</i>. The rest are
  mimics of this dominant species, either in the <!-- Page 136 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page136"></a>{136}</span>Batesian or Müllerian
  sense. Batesian mimics are such genera as <i>Dismorphia</i> and
  <i>Protogonius</i>, to which there are no reasons for attributing
  disagreeable properties. Of the nature of Müllerian mimics on the other
  hand are the various Heliconines and Ithomiines which enter into the
  combination. In each case the whole assemblage is a great "mimicry ring,"
  of which the pattern is dictated by the Ithomiine that predominates in
  point of numbers. It is, however, very doubtful whether this can be
  accepted as a satisfactory explanation. The four groups which we have
  considered are all characterised by a peculiar and distinctive
  coloration, and in each case the pattern must on the theory of mimicry be
  regarded as a highly efficient warning pattern. One or other of these
  patterns must doubtless be looked upon as the most primitive. If so the
  question at once arises as to why a distasteful genus should change from
  one efficient warning pattern to another quite distinct one. If the newer
  pattern affords better protection we should expect it to have spread and
  eventually to have ousted the older one. That it has not done so must
  probably be attributed to the old pattern being as efficient as the new
  one. But if this is so we are left without grounds for assuming the
  change to have been brought about by natural selection through the agency
  of enemies to whom warning colours appeal. For natural selection can only
  bring about a change that is beneficial to the species. Hence we must
  suppose the change on the part of the dominant model to have been
  independent of natural selection by <!-- Page 137 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page137"></a>{137}</span>enemies, and due to
  some condition or set of conditions of which we are ignorant. It is not
  inconceivable that the new colour scheme was associated with some
  physiological peculiarity which was advantageous to the species in its
  altered surroundings. If so natural selection may have favoured the new
  variety, not because of its colour scheme, but owing to the underlying
  physiological differences of which the pattern is but an outward sign.
  And if this could happen in one species there seems to be no reason why
  it should not happen in others. The weak point of the explanation on the
  mimicry hypothesis is that it offers no explanation of the change in the
  so-called dominant Ithomiine pattern as we pass from one region to
  another. Whatever the cause of this change may be there would appear to
  be nothing against it having also operated to produce similar changes in
  other unrelated species, in which case the mimicry hypothesis becomes
  superfluous. It is not unlikely that the establishing of these new forms
  was due to natural selection. If they were associated with physiological
  peculiarities better adapted for their environment it is reasonable to
  suppose that natural selection would favour their persistence as opposed
  to the older type until the latter was eliminated. But such action on the
  part of natural selection is quite distinct from that postulated on the
  mimicry hypothesis. On the one view the colour itself is selected because
  it is of direct advantage to its possessor; on the other view the colour
  pattern is associated with a certain physiological constitution which
  places the <!-- Page 138 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page138"></a>{138}</span>butterflies possessing it at an advantage
  as compared with the rest<a name="footnotetag88"
  href="#footnote88"><sup>[88]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>It is, nevertheless, possible that mimicry may have played some part
  in connection with establishing the new colour pattern in some of these
  South American species. For if the new pattern had become established in
  the predominant distasteful species, and if some of the members of a
  palatable form (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Protogonius</i>) were to shew a variation
  similar to that already established in the distasteful species, and if
  further there be granted the existence of appropriate enemies, then it
  would be almost certain that the newer form in palatable species would
  eventually replace the older form. In such a case the part played by
  natural selection would be the preservation of a chance sport which
  happened to look like an unpalatable form. There is no reason for
  regarding the change as necessarily brought about by the gradual
  accumulation of a long series of very small variations through the
  operation of natural selection.</p>

<h5>CHAPTER XI</h5>

<h5 class="scac">CONCLUSION</h5>

  <p>From the facts recorded in the preceding chapters it is clear that
  there are difficulties in the way of accepting the mimicry theory as an
  explanation of the remarkable resemblances which are often found between
  butterflies belonging to distinct groups. Of these difficulties two stand
  out beyond the rest, viz., the difficulty of finding the agent that shall
  exercise the appropriate powers of discrimination, and the difficulty of
  fitting in the theoretical process involving the incessant accumulation
  of minute variations with what is at present known of the facts of
  heredity.</p>

  <p>With regard to the former of these two difficulties we have seen that
  the supporters of the theory regard birds as the main selective agent. At
  the outset we are met with the fact that relatively few birds have been
  observed to prey habitually on butterflies, while some at any rate of
  those that do so shew no discrimination between what should be
  theoretically pleasant to eat and what should not be pleasant. Even if
  birds are the postulated enemies it must be further shewn that they
  exercise the postulated discrimination. It is required of them that they
  should do two things. <!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page140"></a>{140}</span>In the first place they must confuse an
  incipient or "rough" mimic with a model sufficiently often to give it an
  advantage over those which have not varied in the direction of the model.
  In other words, they must be easily taken in. Secondly, they are expected
  to bring about those marvellously close resemblances that sometimes occur
  by confusing the exact mimicking pattern with the model, while at the
  same time eliminating those which vary ever so little from it. In other
  words, they must be endowed with most remarkably acute powers of
  discrimination. Clearly one cannot ask the same enemy to play both parts.
  If, therefore, birds help to bring about the resemblance we must suppose
  that it is done by different species&mdash;that there are some which do
  the rough work, others which do the smoothing, and others again which put
  on the final polish and keep it up to the mark. This is, of course, a
  possibility, but before it can be accepted as a probability some evidence
  must be forthcoming in its favour.</p>

  <p>But even if the difficulty of the appropriate enemy be passed over,
  and it be granted that a mimetic resemblance can be built up through a
  number of small separate steps, which have become separately established
  through the agency of separate species of birds with various but distinct
  discriminating powers, we are left face to face with an even more serious
  physiological difficulty. For why is it that when the end form which is
  supposed to have resulted from this process is crossed back with the
  original form all <!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page141"></a>{141}</span>the intermediate steps do not reappear?
  Why is it that when the altered germplasm is mingled with the original
  germplasm the various postulated stages between them are not reformed?
  For in various cases where we know the course of evolution this does
  occur. The pale pink sweet-pea has come from the wild purple by a series
  of definite steps, and when it is crossed back with the wild form the
  resulting plants give the series of stages that have occurred in the
  evolution of the pink. So also when the orange rabbit is crossed with the
  wild grey form and the offspring are inbred there are reproduced the
  black, the tortoiseshell, and the chocolate, forms which are stages in
  the evolution of the orange from the wild grey. If then, to take an
  example, the "aristolochiae" form of <i>Papilio polytes</i> has been
  derived from the male-like form by a series of steps, why do we not get
  these steps reproduced after the germplasms of the two forms have been
  mingled? From the standpoint of modern genetic work the inference is that
  these postulated intermediate steps have never existed&mdash;that the one
  form of <i>polytes</i> female came directly from the other, and was not
  built up gradually through a series of stages by the selective agency of
  birds or any other discriminating enemy.</p>

  <p>These two objections, viz. the difficulty of finding the appropriate
  enemy, and the non-appearance of intermediates when the extreme forms are
  crossed, may, perhaps, be said to constitute the main objections to the
  current theory of mimicry. Others such as <!-- Page 142 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page142"></a>{142}</span>the relative scarcity
  of mimicry in the male sex and the existence of cases of polymorphism
  among females of a species which cannot possibly be explained on mimetic
  lines have already been mentioned. But while the main objections remain
  it is hardly necessary to insist upon these others. Looked at critically
  in the light of what we now know about heredity and variation the mimicry
  hypothesis is an unsatisfactory explanation of the way in which these
  remarkable resemblances between different species of butterflies have
  been brought about. Sometimes this is admitted by those who nevertheless
  embrace the theory with a mild aloofness. For they argue that even though
  it does not explain all the facts no other theory explains so many.
  Others have sought an explanation in what has sometimes been termed the
  hypothesis of external causes, regarding these resemblances as brought
  about by similar conditions of soil and climate, and so forth. It is not
  inconceivable that certain types of colour and pattern may be the
  expression of deep-seated physiological differences, which place their
  possessors at an advantage as compared with the rest of the species. Were
  this so it is but reasonable to suppose that they would become
  established through the agency of natural selection. But it is difficult,
  if not impossible, to regard this as a satisfactory solution, if for no
  other reason than that it offers no explanation of polymorphism. For
  example, each of the three forms of <i>polytes</i> female holds its own
  and all must, therefore, be regarded as equally well adapted to the
  circumstances under which <!-- Page 143 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page143"></a>{143}</span>they live. They are so distinct in colour
  that it is difficult on this hypothesis to suppose that they are all on
  the same footing in respect to their environment. Yet if one is better
  off than the others, how is it that these still exist?</p>

  <p>Those who have examined long series of these cases of resemblance
  among butterflies find it hard to believe that there is not some
  connection between them apart from climatic influence. One feels that
  they are too numerous and too striking to be all explained away as mere
  coincidences engendered by like conditions. Nor is it improbable that
  natural selection in the form of the discriminating enemy may have played
  a part in connection with them, though a different one from that
  advocated on the current theory of mimicry. If we assume that sudden and
  readily appreciable variations of the nature of "sports" turn up from
  time to time, and if these variations happen to resemble a form protected
  by distastefulness so closely that the two can be confused by an enemy
  which has learned to avoid the latter, then there would appear to be good
  grounds for the mimicking sport becoming established as the type form of
  the species. For it has already been seen that a rare sport is not
  swamped by intercrossing with the normal form, but that on the contrary
  if it possess even a slight advantage, it must rapidly displace the form
  from which it sprang (cf. Chap. VIII). On this view natural selection in
  the form of the discriminating enemy will have played its part, but now
  with a difference. Instead of building up a <!-- Page 144 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page144"></a>{144}</span>mimetic likeness bit by
  bit it will merely have conserved and rendered numerically preponderant a
  likeness which had turned up quite independently. The function of natural
  selection in respect of a mimetic likeness lies not in its formation but
  in its conservation. It does not bring about the likeness, neither does
  it accentuate it: it brings about the survival of those forms which
  happen to shew the likeness. Why variations on the part of one species
  should bear a strong resemblance to other, and often distantly related,
  species is another question altogether.</p>

  <p>Even a superficial survey of the facts makes it evident that cases of
  mimicry tend to run in series&mdash;that a closely related series of
  mimics, though often of very different pattern and colour, tends to
  resemble a closely related series of models. In Asia we have the
  Cosmodesmus Papilios mimicking a series of Danaines, while the true
  Papilios (cf. Appendix II) tend to resemble a series of the less
  conspicuous members of the Pharmacophagus group. In the same region the
  various species of <i>Elymnias</i> form a series resembling a series of
  Danaines. In Africa there stands out the Cosmodesmus group again
  mimicking a Danaine series, and in part also an Acraeine series.
  Overlapping the Acraeines again are various forms of the Nymphaline genus
  <i>Pseudacraea</i>. It is also of interest that in <i>Danais
  chrysippus</i> and <i>Acraea encedon</i> the Danaine and Acraeine series
  overlap (cf. <a href="#plateIX">Pl. IX</a>). Similar phenomena occur also
  in South America, where closely parallel series of colour patterns are
  exhibited by several <!-- Page 145 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page145"></a>{145}</span>Ithomiines, by <i>Heliconius</i>,
  <i>Lycorea</i>, <i>Dismorphia</i>, and other genera (cf. p. <a
  href="#page39">39</a>). On the other hand such mimetic resemblances as
  are shewn by the South American Swallow-tails of the Papilio and
  Cosmodesmus groups are almost all with the Pharmacophagus group, and
  almost all of the red-black kind (cf. p. <a href="#page43">43</a>).</p>

  <p>On the whole it may be stated that the majority of cases of mimicry
  fall into one or other of such series as the above. If we select a case
  of mimicry at random we shall generally find that there are at least
  several close allies of the mimic resembling several close allies of the
  model. Isolated cases such as the resemblance between <i>Pareronia</i>
  and <i>Danais</i> (p. <a href="#page23">23</a>), between <i>Archonias</i>
  and a Pharmacophagus Papilio (p. <a href="#page43">43</a>), or the
  extraordinary instance of <i>Papilio laglaizei</i> and <i>Alcidis
  agathyrsus</i>, must be regarded as exceptional.</p>

  <p>We have before us then a number of groups of butterflies each with a
  series of different colour patterns. In each group a portion of the
  series overlaps a portion of the series belonging to another more or less
  distantly related group. In the light of recent discoveries connected
  with heredity and variation the natural interpretation to such a set of
  phenomena would be somewhat as follows: Each group of Lepidoptera, such
  as those just discussed, contains, spread out among its various members,
  a number of hereditary factors for the determination of colour pattern.
  Within the group differences of pattern depend upon the presence or
  absence of this or that factor, the variety of pattern being the result
  of the many possible permutations and <!-- Page 146 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page146"></a>{146}</span>combinations of these
  colour factors. Within the limits of each group is found a definite
  number of these factors&mdash;more in one group, less in another. But
  some factors may be common to two or more groups, in which case some of
  the permutations of the factors would be similar in the groups and would
  result in identical or nearly identical pattern. To take a simple example
  in illustration, let us suppose that a given group, (<span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span>), contains the eight factors <i>A-H</i>. Since
  any species in the group may exhibit any combination of one or more of
  these factors it follows that a considerable number of different forms
  are possible. Now suppose that another group, (<span
  class="grk">&beta;</span>), distinguished from (<span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span>) by definite structural features, also
  contains eight factors within the group, and that these factors are
  <i>F-M</i>, <i>F</i>, <i>G</i>, and <i>H</i> being common to both (<span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span>) and (<span class="grk">&beta;</span>). Any
  combination therefore in (<span class="grk">&alpha;</span>) lacking the
  factors <i>A-E</i> will be paralleled by any combination in (<span
  class="grk">&beta;</span>) lacking the factors <i>I-M</i>. For in both
  cases we should be dealing only with the factors <i>F</i>, <i>G</i>, and
  <i>H</i>, which are common to each group. So again a third group might
  have some factors in common with (<span class="grk">&alpha;</span>) and
  some with (<span class="grk">&beta;</span>), and so on for other groups.
  In this way certain of the series of colour patterns found in (<span
  class="grk">&beta;</span>) would overlap certain of those in (<span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span>), while others of the groups (<span
  class="grk">&beta;</span>) and (<span class="grk">&alpha;</span>) might
  overlap those found in different groups again. The striking resemblances
  not infrequently found between species belonging to quite distinct groups
  would on this view depend upon the hereditary factors for pattern and
  colour being limited <!-- Page 147 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page147"></a>{147}</span>in number, so that the same assortment
  might not infrequently be brought together even though the group whose
  members exhibited the resemblance might, owing to structural differences,
  be placed in different families.</p>

  <p>We know from recent experimental work that something of the sort is to
  be found in the coat colours of different rodents. Agouti, black,
  chocolate, blue-agouti, blue, and fawn form a series of colours common to
  the rabbit, the mouse, and the guinea-pig. These colours are related to
  each other in the same way in these different beasts. In the rat, on the
  other hand, there occur of this range of colours only the agouti and the
  black. Each of these species again has certain colour patterns which are
  peculiar to itself, such as the "English" type in the rabbit, the
  tricolor pattern in the guinea-pig, or the "hooded" variety in the rat.
  The total range of colour and pattern is somewhat different for each
  species, but a few are common to them all. Moreover, there are others
  which are common to the mouse and the rabbit but are not found in the
  guinea-pig, and others again which may occur in the rabbit and the
  guinea-pig but have not been met with in the other two. In certain
  features the rabbit might be said to "mimic" the mouse, and in other
  features the guinea-pig. It is not, of course, suggested that the case of
  the butterflies is so simple as that of the rodents, but so far as we can
  see at present there would seem to be no reason why the explanation
  should not be sought along the same lines. <!-- Page 148 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page148"></a>{148}</span>On this view the
  various colour patterns found among butterflies depend primarily upon
  definite hereditary factors of which the number is by no means enormous.
  Many of these factors are common to several or many different groups, and
  a similar aggregate of colour factors, whether in an Ithomiine, a Pierid,
  or a Papilio, results in a similar colour scheme. The likeness may be
  close without being exact because the total effect is dependent in some
  degree on the size and relative frequency of the scales and other
  structural features. In so far as pattern goes <i>Hypolimnas dubius</i>
  and <i>Amauris echeria</i> (<a href="#plateVIII">Pl. VIII</a>, figs. 7
  and 8) are exceedingly close. But inspection at once reveals a difference
  in the quality of the scaling, giving to the <i>Hypolimnas</i>, where the
  black and yellow meet, a softness or even raggedness of outline, which is
  distinct from the sharper and more clear-cut borders of the
  <i>Amauris</i>. It is not unreasonable to suppose that these species
  carry identical factors for colour pattern, and that the differences by
  which the eye distinguishes them are dependent upon the minuter
  structural differences such as occur in the scaling. So the eye would
  distinguish between a pattern printed in identical colours on a piece of
  cretonne and a piece of glazed calico. Though pattern and colour were the
  same the difference in material would yield a somewhat different
  effect.</p>

  <p>On the view suggested the occurrence of mimetic resemblances is the
  expression of the fact that colour pattern is dependent upon definite
  hereditary factors of which the total number is by no means very great.
  <!-- Page 149 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page149"></a>{149}</span>As many of the factors are common to
  various groups of butterflies it is to be expected that certain of the
  colour patterns exhibited by one group should be paralleled by certain of
  those found in another group. That cases of resemblance should tend to
  run in parallel series in different groups is also to be expected, for in
  some groups the number of factors in common is likely to be greater than
  in other groups. In consonance with this view is the fact that where
  polymorphism occurs among the females of a mimicking species the models,
  though often widely different in appearance, are, as a rule, closely
  related. Some of the Asiatic Papilios, for instance, resemble Danaines,
  while others resemble Pharmacophagus Papilios. But although the
  polymorphism exhibited by the females of a given species may be very
  marked, we do not find one of them resembling a Danaine and another a
  Pharmacophagus Swallow-tail. The models of a polymorphic mimic are almost
  always closely related species<a name="footnotetag89"
  href="#footnote89"><sup>[89]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>In discussing the problems of mimicry more attention is naturally paid
  to groups which exhibit the phenomenon than to those which either do not
  do so, or else only do so to a very limited extent. Yet the latter may be
  of considerable interest. Among the Pieridae of the Old World the
  phenomenon of mimicry is very rare. <i>Pareronia</i> and <i>Aporia
  agathon</i> conform <!-- Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page150"></a>{150}</span>closely to the common Danaid type
  represented by <i>Danais vulgaris</i> and other species, but apart from
  these none of the many Pierids in Asia resemble any of the recognised
  models. Africa is apparently destitute of Pierids which mimic species
  belonging to other groups. Yet no group of butterflies is more persecuted
  by birds. Of all the instances of bird attacks collected together by
  Marshall<a name="footnotetag90" href="#footnote90"><sup>[90]</sup></a>
  more than one-third are instances of attacks upon this group alone. If
  birds are the agents by which mimetic likenesses are built up through the
  cumulative selection of small variations, how can the rarity or absence
  of mimetic Pierids in the Old World be accounted for? For the species of
  Pierids, like the species of other families, shew considerable variation,
  and if this process of selection were really at work one would expect to
  find many more Pierid mimics in these regions than actually occur. It is
  true that the white, yellow, and red pigments found in Pierids differ
  from those of other butterflies in being composed either of uric acid or
  of some substance closely allied to that body<a name="footnotetag91"
  href="#footnote91"><sup>[91]</sup></a>. These substances are generally
  found between the two layers of chitin, of which the scale is composed,
  whereas the black pigment is intimately associated with the chitin of the
  scale itself. What is perhaps the principal factor in the formation of a
  mimetic likeness is the distribution of the black pigment with reference
  to the lighter pigments; and although the latter are chemically distinct
  <!-- Page 151 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page151"></a>{151}</span>in the Pierids as compared with other
  butterflies, there would seem to be no reason why the same factors
  governing the distribution of black should not be common to members of
  different groups. A distribution of black pigment similar to that found
  in a model and its mimic may occur also in a non-mimetic ally of the
  mimic. <i>Dismorphia astynome</i>, for example, resembles the Ithomiine
  <i>Mechanitis lysimnia</i> (<a href="#plateXV">Pl. XV</a>, fig. 8) both
  in the distribution of black as well as of yellow and bright brown
  pigments. A similar distribution of the black pigment is also found in
  <i>Dismorphia avonia</i>, but the yellow and bright brown of the other
  two species is here replaced with white. By a slight though definite
  alteration in chemical composition this white pigment could be changed
  into bright brown and yellow with the result that <i>D. avonia</i> would
  closely resemble <i>D. astynome</i> in its colour scheme and would in
  this way also become a mimic of <i>Mechanitis lysimnia</i>. Another good
  instance is that of the females of <i>Perrhybris demophile</i> and <i>P.
  lorena</i>, the former being black and white, whereas in the latter the
  white is replaced by yellow and bright brown, giving the insect a typical
  Ithomiine appearance<a name="footnotetag92"
  href="#footnote92"><sup>[92]</sup></a>. Here again a definite small
  change in the composition of the pigment laid down in the scales would
  result in the establishing of a mimetic likeness where there would
  otherwise be not even a suggestion of it. It is in accordance with what
  we know to-day of variation <!-- Page 152 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page152"></a>{152}</span>that such a change should appear suddenly,
  complete from the start. And if so there is no difficulty in supposing
  that it might be of some advantage to its possessor through the
  resemblance to an unpalatable form. Even were the advantage but a slight
  one it is clear from previous discussion (p. <a href="#page96">96</a>)
  that the new variety would more or less rapidly replace the form from
  which it had sprung. With the continued operation of natural selection
  the new form would entirely supplant the original one, but it is not
  impossible that in some cases the selecting agent may be removed before
  this result has been achieved. In this event the proportions of the new
  and the old form would fall into a condition of equilibrium as in <i>P.
  polytes</i> in Ceylon, until some other selective agent arose to disturb
  the balance. On this view natural selection is a real factor in
  connection with mimicry, but its function is to conserve and render
  preponderant an already existing likeness, not to build up that likeness
  through the accumulation of small variations, as is so generally assumed.
  Recent researches in heredity and variation all point to this restriction
  of the scope of natural selection. Hitherto an argument in favour of the
  older view has been that derived from the study of adaptation&mdash;of an
  apparent purpose, which, at first sight, appears to be behind the manner
  in which animals fit into their surroundings. For many the explanation of
  this apparent purpose has been found in the process of natural selection
  operating gradually upon small variations, accumulating some and
  rejecting <!-- Page 153 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page153"></a>{153}</span>others, working as it were upon a plastic
  organism, moulding it little by little to a more and more perfect
  adaptation to its surroundings. On this view adaptation is easy to
  understand. The simplicity of the explanation is in itself attractive.
  But when the facts come to be examined critically it is evident that
  there are grave, if not insuperable, difficulties in the way of its
  acceptance. To outline some of these has been the object of the present
  essay. Though suggestions have been made as to the lines along which an
  explanation may eventually be sought it is not pretended that the
  evidence is yet strong enough to justify more than suggestions. Few cases
  of mimicry have as yet been studied in any detail, and until this has
  been done many of the points at issue must remain undecided.
  Nevertheless, the facts, so far as we at present know them, tell
  definitely against the views generally held as to the part played by
  natural selection in the process of evolution.</p>

<h5>APPENDIX I</h5>

  <p>For the table on p. <a href="#page155">155</a> I am indebted to the
  kindness of Mr H. T. J. Norton of Trinity College, Cambridge. It affords
  an easy means of estimating the change brought about through selection
  with regard to a given hereditary factor in a population of mixed nature
  mating at random. It must be supposed that the character depending upon
  the given factor shews complete dominance, so that there is no visible
  distinction between the homozygous and the heterozygous forms. The three
  sets of figures in the left-hand column indicate different positions of
  equilibrium in a population consisting of homozygous dominants,
  heterozygous dominants, and recessives. The remaining columns indicate
  the number of generations in which a population will pass from one
  position of equilibrium to another, under a given intensity of selection.
  The intensity of selection is indicated by the fractions <span
  class="spp">100</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">50</span>, <span
  class="spp">100</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">75</span>, etc. Thus <span
  class="spp">100</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">75</span> means that where
  the chances of the favoured new variety of surviving to produce offspring
  are 100, those of the older variety against which selection is operating
  are as 75; there is a 25% selection rate in favour of the new form.</p>

  <p>The working of the table may perhaps be best explained by a couple of
  simple examples.</p>

  <p>In a population in equilibrium consisting of homozygous dominants,
  heterozygous dominants and recessives the last named class comprises 2.8%
  of the total: assuming that a 10% selection rate now operates in its
  favour as opposed to the two classes of dominants&mdash;in how many
  generations will the recessive come to constitute one-quarter of the
  population? The answer is to be looked for in column B (since the
  favoured variety is recessive) under the fraction <span
  class="spp">100</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">90</span>. The recessive
  passes from 2.8% to 11.1% of the population in 36 generations, and from
  11.1% to 25% in a further 16 generations&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> under a 10%
  selection rate in its favour the proportion of the recessive rises from
  2.8% to 25% in 52 generations.</p>

  <p>If the favoured variety is dominant it must be borne in mind that it
  can be either homozygous or heterozygous&mdash;that for these purposes it
  is represented in the left-hand column by the hybrids as well as by the
  homozygous dominant. In a population in equilibrium which contains about
  2% of a dominant form, the great bulk of these dominants will be
  heterozygous, and the relative proportion of recessives, heterozygous,
  and homozygous dominants is given in the second line of the left-hand
  column.</p>

  <p>Let us suppose now that we want to know what will be the percentage of
  dominants after 1000 generations if they form 2% of the population to
  start with, and if, during this period, they have been favoured with a 1%
  selection advantage. After 165 generations the proportion of recessives
  is 90.7, so that the proportion of dominants has risen to over 9%; after
  153 further generations the percentage of dominants becomes 27.7 + 2.8 =
  30.5; after 739 generations it is 88.8%, and after 1122 generations it is
  69.0 + 27.7 = 96.7. Hence the answer to our question will be between 89%
  and 97%, but nearer to the latter figure than the former.</p>

  <p>Mr Norton has informed me that the figures in the table are accurate
  to within about 5%.</p>

<h5>APPENDIX II</h5>

  <p>The genus <i>Papilio</i> is a large and heterogeneous collection. It
  was pointed out by Haase<a name="footnotetag93"
  href="#footnote93"><sup>[93]</sup></a> that it falls into three distinct
  sections, of which one&mdash;the Pharmacophagus section&mdash;provides
  those members which serve as models in mimicry; while in the other two
  sections are found mimics, either of Pharmacophagus Swallow-tails, or of
  models belonging to other groups. Though Haase's terms have not yet come
  into general use with systematists, there is little doubt that the genus
  <i>Papilio</i> as it now stands must eventually be broken up on these
  lines. To say that one species of <i>Papilio</i> mimics another is
  therefore somewhat misleading; for the differences between the
  Pharmacophagus group and the other two are such as to constitute at any
  rate generic distinction in other groups. For convenience of reference a
  table has been added in which the various Papilios mentioned in the text
  have been assigned to their appropriate sections, and referred to their
  respective models. <!-- Page 158 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>"A new impression cannot fail to be welcomed by those who already have
  it as well as those who have it not.... <i>Mendel's Principles of
  Heredity</i> is already a classic. It marks a position of stability
  towards which previous work is now seen to have logically converged, and
  from which new and active research is to-day no less logically diverging.
  The various waves of biological thought are constantly intersecting,
  mingling, and passing on with altered rhythm, but it rarely happens that
  so many meet together at a nodal point as during the last decade.... As
  an analysis of that point, as a picture of how it has come into being,
  and as a foreshadowing of happenings in the near future, <i>Mendel's
  Principles</i> stands alone, and it is good to know that the generations
  of students now growing up cannot be cut off from the possession of a
  book so full of inspiration."&mdash;<i>Gardeners' Chronicle</i></p>

  <p><a name="footnote2" href="#footnotetag2">[2]</a> Ray gives the case of
  an elephant "that was observed always when he slept to keep his trunk so
  close to the ground, that nothing but Air could get in between them," and
  explains it as an adaptation in habit to prevent the mice from crawling
  into its lungs&mdash;"a strange sagacity and Providence in this Animal,
  or else an admirable instinct."</p>

  <p><a name="footnote6" href="#footnotetag6">[6]</a> In attributing this
  quality to the butterflies in question I am merely stating what is held
  by the supporters of the mimicry theory. I know of scarcely any evidence
  either for or against the supposition.</p>

  <p><a name="footnote7" href="#footnotetag7">[7]</a> It is assumed that

  butterflies have been recently monographed by Eltringham in a large and
  beautifully illustrated work&mdash;<i>African Mimetic Butterflies</i>,
  Oxford, 1910.</p>

  <p><a name="footnote10" href="#footnotetag10">[10]</a> Omitting the
  Hesperidae which hardly enter into questions of mimicry.</p>

  <p><a name="footnote11" href="#footnotetag11">[11]</a> The classification
  adopted is that used by Dr Sharp in the "Cambridge Natural History,"
  <i>Insects</i>, vol. 2, 1901.</p>

  <p><a name="footnote13" href="#footnotetag13">[13]</a> <i>African Mimetic
  Butterflies</i>, Oxford, 1910.</p>

  <p><a name="footnote14" href="#footnotetag14">[14]</a> These African
  species of <i>Hypolimnas</i> are frequently referred to the genus
  <i>Euralia</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="footnote15" href="#footnotetag15">[15]</a> Corresponding to
  the <i>dorippus</i> form of <i>D. chrysippus</i> (cf. <a
  href="#plateIX">Pl. IX</a>) there is a rare form of <i>trophonius</i>
  known as <i>dorippoides</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="footnote16" href="#footnotetag16">[16]</a> These two forms
  are figured on Plate 10 of Eltringham's <i>African Mimetic
  Butterflies</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="footnote17" href="#footnotetag17">[17]</a> <i>Acraea
  violae</i>, the only representative of the group in S. India and Ceylon,
  is nevertheless a very abundant insect. It cannot, however, be said that
  it is definitely mimicked by any other species in this region.</p>

  <p><a name="footnote18" href="#footnotetag18">[18]</a> Coloured figures
  of these and of the other African species referred to may be found in
  Eltringham's work on <i>African Mimetic Butterflies</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="footnote19" href="#footnotetag19">[19]</a> These descriptions
  are taken from preserved specimens which I owe for the most part to the
  kindness of Dr Jordan. I have not had an opportunity of examining fresh
  ones.</p>

  <p><a name="footnote20" href="#footnotetag20">[20]</a> This is more
  marked in <i>Castnia</i> than in <i>Anthomysa</i>. It appears to be a
  peculiarity of many members of the genus <i>Castnia</i> that the scales
  do not lie so tight as generally in moths. Owing to this, some of the
  large whole-coloured species have a somewhat fluffy look.</p>

  <p><a name="footnote27" href="#footnotetag27">[27]</a> These
  "unpalatable" butterflies are sometimes extensively preyed upon by
  insectivorous birds, when they fall an easier prey owing to their
  slowness (cf. p. <a href="#page112">112</a>).</p>

  <p><a name="footnote33" href="#footnotetag33">[33]</a> <i>H. misippus</i>
  was at one time regarded as a clear case of Batesian mimicry. But in view
  of its plentifulness, of the fact that it may be abundant outside the
  area inhabited by its model, and of the ease with which it can establish
  itself in parts remote from its original habitat, <i>e.g.</i> S. America,
  it has come to be regarded by certain supporters of the mimicry theory as
  a Müllerian mimic. Cf. Poulton, <i>Essays on Evolution</i>, 1908, pp.
  215-217.</p>

  <p><a name="footnote34" href="#footnotetag34">[34]</a> An English

  <p><a name="footnote36" href="#footnotetag36">[36]</a> Provided of course
  that the type form remains in the majority. If the variation occurred
  simultaneously in more than 50% of <i>A</i> the advantage would naturally
  be with the variation.</p>

  <p><a name="footnote37" href="#footnotetag37">[37]</a> It is possible to
  imagine an exceptional case though most unlikely that it would occur.
  Suppose for example that there were a number of distasteful species, say
  20, all of different patterns, and suppose that in all of them a
  particular variation occurred simultaneously; then if the total shewing
  that variation from among the 20 species were greater than the number of
  any one of the species, all of the 20 species would come to take on the
  form of the new variation. In this way it is imaginable that the new
  pattern would gradually engulf all the old ones.</p>

  <p><a name="footnote49" href="#footnotetag49">[49]</a> If for example
  there were 5000 dominants and 4000 recessives, and if only half of the
  population survives to mate, then we should be left with 2500 dominants
  and 2000 recessives as parents of the next generation. But if there were
  also a 10% selective disadvantage working against the recessives, their
  numbers would be further reduced from 2000 to 1800 and the proportion of
  dominants to recessives would be changed from 5:4 to 25:18.</p>

  <p><a name="footnote54" href="#footnotetag54">[54]</a> An interesting
  case of a similar nature has recently been published by Hasebroek (<i>Die
  Umschau</i>, 1913, p. 1020). A melanic form of the moth, <i>Cymatophora
  or</i>, suddenly appeared near Hamburg in 1904. This new form, to which
  the name <i>albingensis</i> was given, rapidly became the predominant
  one. In 1911-1912 over 90% of the moths reared from caterpillars taken in
  the open were of the <i>albingensis</i> form; nor were any intermediates
  found between it and the typical form. Some experiments were also made
  which shew that the <i>albingensis</i> form behaves as a dominant to the
  original type form.</p>

  <p>"You have asked me about monkeys eating butterflies. This is very
  common, as every native will tell you. I have seen it myself. The monkey
  runs along a path, sees some butterflies fluttering round some filth,
  goes very quietly, and seizes one by the wings, puts the solid part
  (body) into his mouth, then pulls the wings off. The poor butterfly goes
  down like any oyster.... The dog-faced baboon and the large brown monkey
  with a very long tail, which seems to be the most common species in this
  colony, are great butterfly-eaters. The little spider-monkey also
  considers a butterfly a treat, and prefers one to a spider."</p>

  a stronger flyer than the various Planemas which it resembles.</p>

  <p><a name="footnote88" href="#footnotetag88">[88]</a> In this connection
  it is of interest that a recent observer with considerable breeding
  experience finds that the dark <i>doubledayaria</i> variety of the
  Peppered Moth is more hardy than the typical form (cf. p. <a
  href="#page101">101</a>). The swift success of the dark variety led some
  to regard it as better protected against bird enemies. It is, however,
  not unlikely that the deeper pigmentation is associated with some
  physiological difference which makes for greater hardiness. See Bowater,
  <i>Journal of Genetics</i>, vol. 3, 1914.</p>
